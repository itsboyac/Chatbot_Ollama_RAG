Cats that are allowed to roam can spread diseases to humans and wildlife,https://theconversation.com/cats-that-are-allowed-to-roam-can-spread-diseases-to-humans-and-wildlife-173613,"For decades, scientists have warned that ecologically destructive activities increase the risk of
diseases spilling over between wildlife and human populations
. Examples of these drivers include climate change,
habitat loss, wildlife trafficking
, environmental contamination, expansion of anthropocentric activities and invasive species introduction.
Domestic animals also contribute to the movement of diseases between species. Free-roaming domestic animals, like cats, can facilitate the spread and transfer of diseases, impacting both humans and wildlife.
Infectious parasites
Free-roaming cats — which include feral, stray and house cats — present a particularly compelling case because of their large population sizes and their central role in the life cycle of a parasite called
Toxoplasma gondii
(
T. gondii
) that infects both wildlife and humans. Most people may have only heard of toxoplasmosis from their doctors during a pregnancy or
in articles on “brain-altering” parasites
.
However,
T. gondii
is one of the most common zoonotic parasites globally and is estimated to affect
about 30 to 50 per cent of the global human population
.
T. gondii
infections can have
severe and life-threatening consequences
; especially for immunocompromised people and infants infected during pregnancy.
Pregnant women are often advised to avoid interacting with cat feces because of the risk posed to their unborn children.

Toxoplasma gondii
forms a permanent resting tissue cyst in the muscle or nervous tissue of a host, so even healthy infected people are impacted. Chronic toxoplasma infections have been linked with illnesses including degenerative neurological diseases, schizophrenia and
brain cancer
.
Domestic cats or wild felids — like lions, jaguars or cougars —
intermittently excrete millions of
T. gondii
eggs (called oocysts)
into the environment
through their feces
. These oocysts persist under favourable conditions for years in water and soil,
with the capacity for long-distance dispersal
.
If any warm-blooded animal ingests an oocyst, it can become infected with
T. gondii
. This can happen if a person or animal ingests oocysts in contaminated water or food, or through eating another animal that has already become infected.
Spreading diseases
Although both wild felids and domestic cats are sources of toxoplasma, domestic cats outnumber wild felids by several orders of magnitude. We recently tested whether mammals living in environments with greater densities of domestic cats would show higher infection rates of
T. gondii
.
While there are no global data sets showing domestic cat densities, domestic cats are closely associated with humans, and therefore, measures of human population density can act as a surrogate for the density of free-roaming cats. Using data from over 200 studies, we demonstrated that indeed,
wildlife living in areas of higher human density
had higher infection rates of
T. gondii
.
We concluded that this higher infection rate occurred due to a combination of two phenomenon: high densities of free-roaming domestic cats producing infected feces, and the loss of natural habitats. Natural ecosystems have important roles in filtering, sequestering and
removing
T. gondii
and
other pathogens
from human, livestock and wildlife exposure pathways. Breaking the lifecycle by preventing cats from hunting and landscape restoration are key preventative measures.
If wildlife have an increased risk of exposure to
T. gondii
in certain areas, then humans and livestock can also be unintended targets. Public health researchers have shown this repeatedly by
sampling soil
,
vegetable gardens
and
playgrounds
.
Rabies risk
Rabies is another disease whose risk is increased by free-roaming cats. In the United States, cats are
the most common rabies positive domestic species
, with cats posing
two-and-a-half times the rabies exposure risk compared to bats in Pennsylvania
. In Canada, we recently found similar public health concerns of free-roaming cats when we
examined patterns of rabies submissions of bats in Canada
.
In Canada, free-roaming cats were associated with 10 times more bats being submitted for rabies testing compared to indoor cats. In fact, in our dataset, there were five records of free-roaming cats bringing bats into the house that subsequently were found to be rabies positive. This hunting activity by cats is obviously dangerous for people in the household, and is a very simple explanation for cases of cryptic rabies infections (rabies cases without an identifiable source).
In areas with large numbers of free-roaming cats predating bats, the risk that a human will be exposed to rabies is expected to increase.
(Jared Hobbs)

This risk is directly proportionate to the frequency of free-roaming cats killing bats, which is unfortunately common. Single cats have been known to
kill a hundred bats in a week
.
In our dataset, one free-roaming cat killed nine endangered little brown bats in one month, with another record of a cat killing 14 bats in a single evening. Many bat populations have undergone severe declines, especially due to
an introduced fungal disease
. Bats are
long-lived with low reproduction
, so this additional source of mortality can severely impact bat populations.
Since cats only bring home
20 per cent of what they kill
, prey returns and rabies submissions only provide a tiny glimpse of the true cat predation rates. It is therefore apparent that although natural rabies prevalence in bats is low —
less than one per cent
— in areas with cats killing large numbers of bats, rabies exposure risks will increase.
Protecting health and wildlife
There is broad consensus among
veterinarians
,
ecologists
,
public health experts
and
animal rights activists
that free roaming by domestic cats is detrimental for feline welfare, wildlife welfare, conservation and human health. Wildlife have the same capacity for distress and pain as domestic animals, and perform irreplaceable ecosystem services with
tangible economic benefits
, making their predation unjustifiable from an ethical or economic perspective.
Free-roaming cats suffer from increased mortality through
traumatic injury, disease, neglect and abandonment
. This marginalization of cats needs to be replaced with
progressive enrichment resources
and
responsible management that does not foster an inhumane and biased disregard
for feline welfare standards, wildlife welfare, conservation and human health.

Working dogs and horses havetax-deductibleupkeep. But Australia’s thousands of working cats go unrecognised,https://theconversation.com/working-dogs-and-horses-have-tax-deductible-upkeep-but-australias-thousands-of-working-cats-go-unrecognised-248675,"Cats and milk often go hand in hand in popular culture. But on dairy farms, cats do much more than enjoy a saucer of milk – their mousing skills are essential. That’s because dairy farms often have a problem with rats and mice due to their large grain and feed stores and a continuous supply of water and shelter.
Cats are thought to have been domesticated to protect granaries from rodents some
9,000 years
ago. In our time, cats are widely used to keep rat and mouse numbers down around houses, farms, horse barns and factories.
But while you can make tax deductions on the upkeep of your working cats in the
United Kingdom
and
United States
, Australia’s thousands of working farm cats are not eligible.  By contrast, farm dogs and horses in all three countries are recognised for the work they do. Their care is a tax-deductible business expense.
Our
new research
explores how cats are used as working animals on dairy farms. We found many dairy farmers preferred using cats over using poison for rodent control. For all farmers, the cost of sterilisation was too much, which can create problems of unchecked breeding. Registration fees are also a barrier.
If the care and upkeep of working cats was tax deductible, Australian farmers could manage their cats better without extra financial strain.

Why are working cats needed?
Dairy farming is Australia’s
third-largest
agricultural industry after cattle and wheat, and Australia is the world’s fourth-largest
dairy exporter
.
Within the industry, there are major changes underway. Small dairy farms are declining due to
economic pressures
. Financial returns
are dropping
and recent
natural disasters
have taken their toll.
To find out about how small and medium scale dairy farms rely on cats, we interviewed 15 dairy farmers in New South Wales and Queensland who had between three and 60 cats on their farms. Our sample of farmers is not representative, as we restricted the study to dairy farmers who had enrolled their cats in a free desexing program.
The dairy farmers we interviewed had come to rely heavily on their cats for ratting and mousing. Cats were not optional – they were essential for pest control.
Dairy farms are
increasingly automated
, with automatic milking machines taking over from humans. But rodents can cause real problems by nibbling through crucial wiring and rubber hosing, causing expensive and disruptive equipment breakdowns. As one farmer told us:
cats are cheaper than an electrician bill.
Another said:
we haven’t had [an equipment] breakdown in seven years since the cats turned up […] That on its own is worth thousands, plus no [downtime] with the milking machines out of action […] yeah, the pluses are just massive.
Dairy farms are increasingly automated – but rats and mice biting through wiring can derail a farmer’s plans.

Rodents also eat and contaminate cattle feed and can spread diseases to
livestock and humans
. More mice and rats means more snakes, posing risks to humans, working dogs and cattle.
One farmer told us:
the cats […] work everyday where baits are only ever any good while you’ve got bait out.
Most of the farmers we interviewed said they would never farm without cats. “We couldn’t do without them now. Otherwise, you’d be overrun with rats”, one said.
Of our 15 interviewees, ten had previously relied on rat poison. The farmers told us poison was less effective, expensive and unsafe. Rat poison poses risks to
wildlife
, working dogs, pets and children. Rats and mice are also
developing resistance
to some poisons. Rat poison has to be continuously applied and can be expensive.
One farmer said:
baiting’s not great for the other wildlife, and we’ve got dogs and I’d prefer not to use the baits.
By contrast, the farmers told us working cats offered a long-term, low-maintenance solution. Farmers reported fewer rodents and fewer snakes.
Farmers clearly saw their cats as working animals. As one said:
they’re dead set working cats because of […] the saving on repairs, the saving on baiting and yeah, the cats are doing their job, they’re basically working for
me.
While some farmers saw the cats as purely functional, others appreciated their companionship, especially during solitary early morning milking.
For some farmers, cats provide companionship during early morning milking.

Is it time for cat deductions?
While our interviewees reported strong upsides to using working cats, there are downsides.
Registration fees and permits can cost thousands of dollars, as an average sized dairy might have 20 or more working cats. There are other costs too, from desexing to tick treatment to vaccination to microchipping. Our
recent research
suggests desexing would reduce the risk from cats going feral.
As one farmer said:
the cost is too great to have to get all those cats done [sterilised] ourselves.
For farmers, these fees may be having unintended consequences such as
added stress
from financial worries and damage to mental health if farmers are
forced to euthanise
cats and kittens for population control. Waiving registration costs for working cats and providing funding to ensure cats are desexed would reduce the impact on wildlife.
At present, the Australian Tax Office
recognises
horses and dogs as working animals – provided they have been “trained for their role from a young age” and are not pets.
State and federal laws would have to be updated so working cats would be considered domestic cats, not feral cats, and biosecurity laws in states
such as Queensland
would have to be clarified. Tax rules would have to be changed too, as working cats would not meet the training requirement for working animals, given cats are natural predators of rodents.
But if these changes were made and farm cats were legally recognised, dairy farmers would have clear incentives to ensure their working cats are desexed, vaccinated and cared for."
Let’s give feral cats their citizenship,https://theconversation.com/lets-give-feral-cats-their-citizenship-45165,"There’s been a lot of talk about killing feral cats, with the government’s recently announced
war on cats
setting the goal of killing two million by 2020.
On The Conversation
last week, Katherine Moseby and John Read explained several different ways to control feral cats, including baiting.
But we would like to offer a different idea: let’s embrace cats as part of Australia’s environment. We could even rename them “Australian wildcats”. Let us explain.
Embracing cats would primarily entail ending our practice of killing cats. This would have many advantages.
It would benefit the cats, because they would no longer endure our increasingly creative methods of ending their lives. We would also benefit greatly by unburdening ourselves of the task of causing
suffering
and death to cats. But what may seem counterintuitive is that leaving cats alone can also benefit Australia’s threatened native species.
Being kind to cats can help native wildlife
Many people love cats and do not want them harmed.
Advocates
for nonlethal approaches to control cat numbers often recommend sterilisation, but this idea is based on the mistaken assumption that feral cats are originating from our homes.
Many cats do live among us, but most now exist in a completely wild state, including in the middle of the driest of deserts and the lushest of rainforests. Sterilisation can help reduce the number of house cats without a home, but it will not benefit wildlife away from cities. We need to move beyond thinking about cats as either wards or enemies.
Several small and medium-sized native species have declined and gone extinct, partially due to non-native cats and foxes. Several decades of conservation efforts have therefore focused on killing these predators, a sufficiently long process to learn that this approach is not working.
Even highly coordinated and intensive eradication programs backfire. This can happen in two ways. Killing cats, even two million of them, can inadvertently increase cat numbers by enabling
more cats
to immigrate into vacant territories. Conversely, cat eradication can cause population booms of other species (such as rabbits and rats) and result in
further harm
.
Ecosystems are notoriously, and wonderfully, complex things. They are comprised of dense networks of interactions that bind the fate of species to one another. Cats have become deeply entangled in this web of life. Attempting to remove cats from Australian ecosystems will not be a clean and painless surgery, and it will not heal the patient.
Coexistence with cats is possible
For many years introduced species were believed to be harmful because natives have not evolved the traits to hold their own against them. But we are learning that species can be surprisingly adaptable.
For example, when native Australian predators first encounter cane toads they often mistake them for just another familiar amphibian and readily eat them, unaware of the toad’s defence – toxic glands on their backs.
Eventually predator populations recover as they
learn
how to eat them, they learn not to eat them, or they adapt to the toxin. Such a remarkable recovery has not occurred for many of the native prey species threatened by cat and fox predation, and not because they are slow. Their difficulty, instead, lies with the very actions we are taking to save them.
The number of cats and their influence on other wildlife are a function of
ecological context
. Major
forces
that influence the ability of prey to coexist with cats include vegetation cover and larger predators. Grazing and fire can reduce vegetation cover and make it harder for prey animals to escape. Significantly, larger predators, such as dingoes, are a major threat to cats.
Dingoes do more than just kill cats, they communicate with them and influence their behaviour. Cats fear dingoes, and
stay away
from areas frequented by them. They also
avoid
hunting when dingoes are most active. This creates areas of safety for the prey of cats. Our poisons and traps kill cats, but tell them nothing.
From foxes to cats
The war on cats is ultimately a consequence of our failed
war on foxes
.
Foxes have long been held as Australia’s primary environmental villain. They are also easier to kill, because they more readily scavenge. Meat baits laced with 1080 poison are used extensively in conservation programs.
This
inhumane
poison kills foxes and dingoes in untold numbers, and enables cats to breed up and move with impunity across the landscape.
For example, a major poison-baiting campaign did help recover endangered woylies for a time, but eventually the loss of foxes and dingoes caused cats to take over and the newly recovered population
collapsed
.
All Australian conservation programs dedicated to restoring small native species on the mainland continue to use 1080. National parks use it. Pastoral stations use it. Councils use it.
It is time to go cold turkey.
Embracing Australia’s wildlife without prejudice
Cats have become an integral part of Australia’s wildlife and beauty. Many native species successfully
coexist with cats
, especially when we leave predators alone.
Australian wildcats probably provide the same ecological functions as they do in their native ranges, such as
suppressing population irruptions
of their prey. Killing cats achieves only one outcome with consistency: it produces dead cats.
However, the aim of conservation is not to generate an ever increasing body count, but to guide human behaviour to enable the rest of the Earth’s species to flourish. Embracing cats is a
paradigm shift
. It means embracing the entirety of Australia’s modern ecosystems - native and feral - and letting go of the past.
It is time to accept these immigrants as Australian citizens.

"How to stroke a cat, according to science",https://theconversation.com/how-to-stroke-a-cat-according-to-science-116025,"Many of us will have experienced that super friendly cat who seems to love being stroked one minute, only to bite or swipe at us the next. It might be easy at this point to blame it on the cat, but what’s likely happening here is that we’re just not stroking them right.
To understand why this might be, we first need to know a bit more about kitty’s ancestry. It’s likely that the domestic cat’s ancestors (the African wildcat) were regarded as mere pest control, but
modern day cats
are often treated as our valued companions or even “fur babies”.
This social shift in the
human-cat relationship
is thought to have occurred around 4,000 years ago –  a little later
than “man’s best friend”
–- the domestic dog. Although this might seem like a sufficient amount of time for a species to fully adjust to increased social demands, this is unlikely to be the case for your feline friend. Domestic cats also display
relatively modest genetic divergence from their ancestors
, meaning their brains are probably still wired to think like a wildcat’s.
Wildcats live solitary lives and invest considerable time and effort communicating indirectly – via visual and chemical messages – just to avoid having to see each other. So it’s unlikely that domestic cats inherited many complex social skills from their relatives.
Humans on the other hand, are an inherently social species – favouring proximity and touch during displays of affection. We are also drawn to infantile looking features – large eyes and forehead, a small nose and round face –  this is why most of us
find the faces of cats so cute
. It’s not surprising, then, that our initial reaction when we see a cat or kitten is to want to stroke, cuddle and smush all over them. Though it should also come as no surprise that many cats can find this type of interaction
a little overwhelming
.
Cat affections
Although a lot of cats
do like being stroked
, and in certain contexts
will choose us over food
, human interaction is something they have to learn to enjoy during their
comparatively short sensitive period
– between two and seven weeks old.
Read more:
Do cats purr when humans aren't around?
When it comes to human-cat interactions, the characteristics of humans are also important. Our
personalities and gender
, the
regions of the cat’s body we touch
and
how we generally handle cats
, may all play an important role in how the cat responds to our affections.
And while some cats may
react aggressively to unwanted physical attention
, others may merely tolerate our social advances
in exchange for the good stuff
(food and lodgings). That said, a tolerant cat is not necessarily a happy cat.
Higher stress levels are reported in cats
that are described by their owners as tolerating rather than actively disliking petting.
How to stroke a cat
The key to success is to focus on providing the cat with as much choice and control during interactions as possible. For example, the choice to indicate whether they want to be petted or not, and control over where we touch them, and how long for.
Due to our tactile nature and love of cute things, this approach may not come instinctively to many of us. And it will likely require a little self-restraint. But it could well pay off, as research shows interactions with cats are likely to last longer when the cat, rather than the human,
initiates them
.
From top left: Levi, Noa, Charlie, Simon and Chris, Rocket and Luna, Smokey Joe, Barry and Pod.
It’s also really important to pay close attention to the cat’s behaviour and posture during interactions, to ensure they are comfortable. When it comes to touch, less is often more. This is not only true
during veterinary handling
, but also during more relaxed encounters with people.
As a general guide, most friendly cats will enjoy being touched around the regions where their facial glands are located, including the base of their ears, under their chin, and around their cheeks. These places are usually preferred over areas such as their tummy, back and
base of their tail
.
Signs of cat enjoyment:
• Tail held upright and choosing to initiate contact.
• Purring and kneading you with their front paws.
• Gently waving their tail from side to side while held in the air.
• A relaxed posture and facial expression, ears pricked and pointed forwards.
• Giving you a gentle nudge if you pause while you’re stroking them.
Signs of dislike or tension:
• Shifting, moving or turning their head away from you.
• Remaining passive (no purring or rubbing)
• Exaggerated blinking, shaking their head or body or licking their nose
• Rapid, short bursts of grooming.
• Rippling or twitching skin, usually along their back.
• Swishing, thrashing or thumping tail.
• Ears flattening to the sides or rotating backwards.
• A sharp sudden turn of their head to face you or your hand.
• Biting, swiping or batting your hand away with their paw.
Whether cats make good “fur babies”, then, is very debatable. Lots of cats do like being touched, but lots probably don’t – and many tolerate it at best. Ultimately though, when it comes to cats, it’s important to
respect their boundaries
– and the wildcat within – even if that means admiring their cuteness from afar."
A hidden toll: Australia’s cats kill almost 650 million reptiles a year,https://theconversation.com/a-hidden-toll-australias-cats-kill-almost-650-million-reptiles-a-year-98854,"Cats take a hefty toll on Australia’s reptiles – killing an estimated 649 million of them every year, including threatened species – according to our new research
published in the journal Wildlife Research
.
This follows the earlier discovery that cats take a similarly huge chunk out of Australian bird populations. As we reported last year,
more than a million Australian birds are killed by cats every day
. Since their introduction to Australia, cats have also driven
many native mammal species
extinct.

For whom the bell tolls: cats kill more than a million Australian birds every day
We collated information from about 100 previous local studies of cats’ diets across Australia. These studies involved teasing apart the contents of more than 10,000 samples of faeces or stomachs from cats collected as part of management programs.
We tallied the number of reptiles found in these samples, and then scaled it up to Australia’s
estimated cat population of between 2.1 million and 6.3 million
. We also collated information from museums and wildlife shelters on the various animals that had been brought in after being killed or injured by cats.
We calculate that an average feral cat kills 225 reptiles per year, so the total feral cat population kills 596 million reptiles per year. This tally will vary significantly from year to year, because the cat population in inland Australia fluctuates widely between drought and rainy years.

We also estimated that the average pet cat kills 14 reptiles per year. That means that Australia’s 3.9 million pet cats kill 53 million reptiles in total each year. However, there is much less firm evidence to quantify the impact of pet cats, mainly because it is much more straightforward to catch and autopsy feral cats to see what they have been eating, compared with pet cats.
Binge eaters
According to our study, cats have been known to kill 258 different Australian reptiles (snakes, lizards and turtles – but not crocodiles!), including 11 threatened species.
The cat autopsies revealed that some cats binge on reptiles, with many cases of individual cats having killed and consumed more than 20 individual lizards within the previous 24 hours. One cat’s stomach was found to contain no less than 40 lizards.

Such intensive predation probably puts severe pressure on local populations of some reptile species. There is now substantial evidence that cats are a primary cause of the ongoing decline of some threatened Australian reptile species, such as the
Great Desert Skink
.
By our estimate, the average Australian feral cat kills four times more lizards than the average free-roaming cat in the United States (which kills
59 individuals per year
). But there are many more such cats in the US (between 30 million and 80 million), so the total toll on reptiles is likely similar.

The war on feral cats will need many different weapons
The conservation of the Australian reptile fauna has been accorded lower public profile than that of many other groups. However, a
recent international program
has nearly completed an assessment of the conservation status of every one of Australia’s roughly 1,000 lizard and snake species.
Our research provides yet more evidence of the harm that cats are wreaking on Australia’s native wildlife. It underlines the need for more effective and strategic control of Australia’s feral cats, and for more responsible ownership of pet cats.
Pet cats that are allowed to roam will kill reptiles, birds and other small animals. Preventing pet cats from roaming will help the cats live
longer and healthier lives
– not to mention saving the lives of wildlife.

A recent parliamentary inquiry into the problem of feral and pet cats in Australia has affirmed the issue is indeed of national significance. The
final report
, released last week, calls for a heightened, more effective, multi-pronged and coordinated policy, management and research response.
As ecologists, we’ve collectively spent more than 50 years researching Australia’s cat dilemma. We welcome most of the report’s recommendations, but in some areas it doesn’t go far enough, missing major opportunities to make a difference.
Night curfews aren’t good enough
The report recommends Australia’s 3.8 million pet cats be subject to night-time curfews. This measure would benefit native nocturnal mammals, but won’t save birds and reptiles, which are primarily active during the day.

Pet cats
kill 83 million native reptiles and 80 million native birds
in Australia each year. From a wildlife perspective, keeping pet cats contained 24/7 is the only responsible option.
It’s clearly possible:
one third
of Australian pet cat owners already keep their pets contained all the time.
Stopping pet cats from roaming is also good for the cats, which
live longer
, safer lives when kept exclusively indoors. It would also substantially reduce the number of
people falling ill from cat-dependent diseases each year
.

Other strategies for improving pet cat management proposed in the report include pet cat registration, subsidised programs for early age desexing, public education campaigns to promote responsible pet cat ownership, and improving the consistency of rules and legislation nationally.
Indoor cats live longer than cats allowed to roam.
Jaana Dielenberg
The report is also unambiguously opposed to “
trap-neuter-release
” programs, in which un-owned cats in urban areas are desexed and then released. We agree with this finding, as these programs aren’t
effective
at reducing the population of stray cats, nor preventing those cats from killing wildlife and spreading disease.
We need more wildlife havens
One of the inquiry’s flagship recommendations is a national conservation project  dubbed “Project Noah”. This would involve an ambitious expansion of Australia’s existing network of reserves free from introduced predators, both on islands and in mainland fenced areas. The reserves provide havens — or a fleet of “arks” — for vulnerable native wildlife.
This measure is vital.
2019 research
found Australia has more than 65 native mammal species and subspecies that can’t persist, or struggle to persist, in places with even very low numbers of cats or foxes. This includes the bilby, numbat, quokka, dibbler and black-footed rock wallaby.
Boodies used to occur across two-thirds of Australia, but now only exist within havens.
McGregor/Arid Recovery
Australia already has more than 125 havens, 100 of which are islands. These have prevented 13 mammal species from going extinct, such as boodies and greater stick-nest rats. In total, these havens have protected populations of 40 mammal species susceptible to cats and foxes.
This is a good start, but we need more investment in havens to prevent extinctions. More than 25 species are highly sensitive to cat and fox predation, but aren’t yet protected in the haven network. This includes the central rock-rat, which is more likely than not to
become extinct within 20 years
without new action.
What’s more, some species, such as the long-nosed potoroo, exist in just one haven. To avoid issues such as inbreeding and to ensure disasters like a fire at any single haven don’t take out an entire species, each species should be represented across several havens, in reasonable population sizes.
The report didn’t specify how the havens network should be expanded. But 2019  research found to get each species needing protection into at least three havens, Australia requires
at least 35
new, strategically located islands or mainland fenced areas.

Australian Wildlife Conservancy
What about the rest of the country?
Havens cover less than 1% of Australia. So what we do in the other 99% of the landscape — including across conservation reserves like national parks — is vital.
Yet the parliamentary inquiry report lacks clear recommendations to expand cat control more broadly, including at important conservation sites such as in Kakadu National Park.
The impact of roaming pet cats on Australian wildlife.
The report reaffirms the need to cull feral cats, and to set new targets for culling, without specifying what those targets are. We agree some culling is important, especially at sites with very vulnerable threatened wildlife.
But in many parts of Australia, broad-scale habitat management is a more cost-effective way to reduce cat harm. This involves making habitat less suitable for cats and more suitable for native wildlife, for example, by reducing rabbit numbers, fire frequency and grazing by feral herbivores such as cattle and horses.
Research has shown
fewer rabbits
leads to fewer cats. Rabbits are a favoured prey of many cats, so they boost feral cat numbers, which then also hunt native wildlife.
Read more:
One cat, one year, 110 native animals: lock up your pet, it's a killing machine
And
cats gravitate
to areas with less vegetation because it’s easier to catch prey. These areas include those with frequent fires, or where feral herbivores have reduced vegetation through grazing and trampling.
Better habitat with more vegetation gives native animals places to hide from predators, and more food and shelter. It’s a bit like giving the last little pig a house of bricks instead of trying to fist-fight the wolf.
Feral horses, such as these in Kakadu National Park, eat and damage vegetation making conditions more favourable for cats to hunt.
Jaana Dielenberg
A major step forward
Over the past two decades, Australia has slowly woken up to the damage cats cause to nature. This has led to more research, management and policy to address the problem.
Some state governments, environment groups and scientists have worked hard to develop feral cat control options, and the
2015 Australian Threatened Species Strategy
did much to focus national attention and resourcing to the issue.

The parliamentary inquiry is a major step forward, and many recommendations are sound. But overall, its recommendations call for incremental improvement.
Australia’s laws clearly fail to provide a safety net for wildlife. The cat issue is part of a larger problem with how we manage habitat, biodiversity and threats to nature – and fixing that requires wholesale change."
The war on feral cats will need many different weapons,https://theconversation.com/the-war-on-feral-cats-will-need-many-different-weapons-44979,"At the
Threatened Species Summit
last week in Melbourne, Environment Minister Greg Hunt and Threatened Species Commissioner Gregory Andrews declared war on feral cats.
Cats are thought to be a
significant contributor
to the decline of many threatened species.
Targets in the released
threatened species strategy
include culling two million cats by 2020, creating new safe havens for threatened species (cat-free islands and sanctuaries), restoring habitat and emergency intervention for our most critically endangered species.
Excluding cats using fencing is an increasingly important tool used to protect threatened species. New exclusion fencing projects received
significant funding
under the latest strategy.
One of us (Katherine) was lucky enough to be asked to give a
presentation
at the summit on alternative methods of controlling feral cats. The following article summarises this presentation and highlights the importance of investing in a broad range of cat control methods.
Cats are highly adaptable and highly variable, hence we must continue to search for their Achilles Heel and invest in a wide range of control methods.
Poison baiting
Widespread poison baiting for cats has come a long way in the last few decades with baits such as Eradicat, Curiosity and a new hybrid Eradicat bait being produced.
These baits were developed after years of research conducted initially by the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife and are a soft meat sausage injected with 1080 poison or containing an encapsulated PAPP (
Para-aminopropiophenone
) pill. These baits have had most success in island eradications and areas where alternative prey are scarce.
In order to kill a cat using poison baits, cats must first find and then ingest the bait.
Unfortunately, cats hunt mainly using sight and sound so finding an inert sausage is a challenge for a cat.
Large numbers of baits must be laid, the usual density is 50 per square km, 10 times higher than the recommended fox baiting density of 5 per square km.
Despite this, many cats fail to find a poison bait before they break down and are no longer toxic. Even when cats do find baits, up to 80% of encounters do not lead to bait ingestion, with cats often ignoring, sniffing or avoiding baits when detected. This is because cats prefer to catch their own prey and will only ingest a bait when hungry.
Non-target uptake can also be high – species such as crows, goannas and quolls can take more than half of laid baits in some instances.
Successful baiting relies on using large densities of baits in areas with low food availability at the right time of year when cats are hungriest. Practitioners are continuing to develop ways of improving bait uptake and several important baiting programs received funding under the Threatened Species Strategy.
Grooming traps
A
recent invention
removes the need for cats to be hungry to ingest poison. An automated grooming trap squirts a poisonous paste onto the fur of the cat as it walks past a trap station, which it then ingests through compulsive grooming.
Cats are fastidious groomers and pen trials have found 9 out of 10 cats will ingest the paste when it is squirted on their fur. The trap uses an array of sensors to restrict triggering to target species and is currently being developed for field trials around Australia. The grooming traps have a silent activation, can store up to 20 doses and can sit unattended for months at a time.
Although unlikely to be used in broadscale applications, the grooming trap may be critical for protecting small threatened species populations and reducing the impacts of cats in areas where food availability is high.
The grooming trap received much needed funding for further development at the Threatened Species Summit.
Get rid of rabbits, get rid of cats
Widespread indirect methods of reducing cat impacts are also important. Recent work  has found that the Rabbit Haemorrhagic Virus Disease (RHVD) (otherwise known as Rabbit Calicivirus) released in 1995 has had a significant positive impact on many desert threatened mammal species.
The range of species such as the Plains Mouse, Dusky Hopping Mouse and Crest-tailed Mulgara has increased by as much as 70 fold in the last 20 years due largely to reduced predation.
RHDV reduced rabbit abundance by up to 95% in the arid zone of Australia which resulted in a natural steep decline in feral cats and foxes, the main predator of rabbits in that region.
The increase in vegetation cover coupled with a massive decline in predation pressure has allowed these native rodents and marsupials to recover.
This would undoubtedly be one of the most significant recoveries of threatened species in Australia. RHVD was relatively cheap, for an initial investment of only $12 million. The agricultural benefit alone totalled
more than A$6 billion
and the benefits to threatened species have been dramatic but remain unquantified.
Other researchers have also found that by manipulating fire and stock grazing pressure, broadscale indirect benefits can be achieved for threatened species through a reduction in susceptibility to cat predation.
These indirect benefits include making it more difficult for cats to hunt by increasing ground cover, and increasing the productivity of the landscape thereby allowing native species to increase their reproductive output and tolerate higher predation pressure.
Serial cats
All cats are not created equal and recent work in the Flinders Ranges National Park has highlighted the impact of catastrophic cats on reintroduction programs. The reintroduction of the western quoll resulted in nearly a third of the quolls being killed by feral cats.

DNA analysis indicated that quolls were killed by large male cats with most cats responsible for multiple kills (Moseby, Peacock and Read,in press,Biological Conservation). These specialist hunters could be targeted by making their prey toxic, in other words employing toxic Trojans (poison capsules implanted under the skin of prey species where they remain stable) to control specialist cats.
Poison capsules can be implanted under the skin of prey species where they remain stable. If a cat kills and ingests a toxic Trojan, the capsule will break down in the acidic environment of the cat’s stomach releasing the poison and preventing it from killing more individuals.  Research is continuing into this poison delivery device which may result in improved targeted cat control.
Get smart
Finally, an ARC linkage grant between the University of New South Wales and
Arid Recovery
is researching ways to improve the anti-predator behaviour of threatened species.
Our native species did not evolve with introduced cats and foxes and hence may exhibit inappropriate or ineffective anti-predator responses. This prey naivety can lead to high susceptibility even to low levels of exotic predators.
Containing our threatened species on off-shore islands or behind fences is potentially exacerbating the issue as they are not exposed to mammalian predators and can develop “island syndrome” where they fail to recognise predators as dangerous.
The project involves trialling “in situ” predator training where low levels of predators are added to populations of threatened species for extended periods to improve their anti-predator behaviour.
The theory is that natural selection and learning will lead to improved survival and behaviour of successive generations of threatened species.
Whilst this may be a long term endeavour, ways of facilitating co-existence and increasing the resilience of our native species to exotic predators are urgently needed as it is likely that the wily feral cat is here to stay.

We wanted to know where Madagascar’s mysterious ‘forest’ cats came from. What we found,https://theconversation.com/we-wanted-to-know-where-madagascars-mysterious-forest-cats-came-from-what-we-found-135216,"Being separated from all other land masses since the late Cretaceous, when dinosaurs still dominated many parts of the Earth, Madagascar has long been referred to
as a
“natural laboratory of evolution”. Its long isolation resulted in unique fauna and flora, most of which have evolved in place.
Madagascar only has four groups of endemic land mammals: primates (lemurs), rodents, Afrotheres (formerly insectivores such as tenrecs), and carnivores. Yet there’s huge diversity within these four groups.
When it comes to endemic terrestrial carnivores, there’s only one group that is recognised: the Eupleridae. Of these, the largest is the fosa. This is neither a felid (cat family) nor a canid (dog family). It is closely related to the mongoose and weighs between 5 and 10 kg. It has long been the primary mammalian predator of lemurs and other Malagasy mammals.
So, the conventional view is that Madagascar has no native cats (i.e. felids). Yet, cats are plentiful on the island.
There are two general types of cats in Madagascar: village cats, and a wild “forest” form. This “forest cat” has long been
distinguished
by the Malagasy from village or feral domestic cats and is often viewed as a threat to domestic animals such as poultry. Given eye-witness accounts and reports – including our own – this little understood, wild “forest cat” is also an effective predator of Madagascar’s famous lemurs.
The “forest cats” are quite distinct in their outward appearance, consistently having a “tabby” or striped fur, longer legs, and a larger size (up to 5kg).
Forest cat.
In contrast, “village” cats generally look like domestic cats seen around the world – a solid fur color (often white), shorter legs and a body size of about 2kg.
Village cat.
The external morphology of the forest cats is thus very different from the village ones. It’s also quite similar – on the surface – to the African wild cats seen in eastern and southern portions of continental Africa.
Therefore, the origin(s) of Madagascar “forest” or “wild” cats has long been a mystery. Are they descended from the African wild cat (
Felis lybica
) arriving with East African pastoralists, who culturally dominate Madagascar’s southern regions? Are they a product of recently arrived domestic cats (
Felis silvestris
) from Europe, the Arabian realm or Southeast Asia?
To determine the origin(s) of Madagascar’s “forest cats”, we and our colleagues, carried out
this study
.
Our findings reveal that Malagasy “forest cats” are descendants of cats from the Arabian Sea region. They did not originate from continental Africa’s wild cats and are instead related to domestic cats.
Cat tracking
Our team – a collaboration between scientists from six countries across three continents – collected genetic data from 30 “forest” cats at two locations in Madagascar, three individuals from the Bezà Mahafaly Special Reserve in the southwest, and 27 individuals from Ankarafantsika National Park in the far north of the island.
These data were compared with approximately 1900 samples from various domestic and wild cats across the world, to assess the degree of relatedness of the Malagasy wild forms.
The data produced by our team – combining the expertise, experience and skills of both field and laboratory scientists – revealed that the Malagasy “forest cats” most closely cluster with domestic cats specifically from the Arabian sea region, including the Kenyan islands of Lamu and Pate. The Malagasy cats are thus descendants of domestic cats from the Arabian Sea region and not continental
Africa’s wild cats
.
Origins
When and how did this diaspora begin? The Arabian Sea and Kenyan Islands cats likely made it to Madagascar over the past millennium, or slightly earlier, by way of the
Arabian sea trade
. There were several waves of migration to Madagascar from the Arabian realm over the past 1000 years or so.
These migrations brought architecture, linguistic components, and eventually a written script by the 18th century. And, they brought cats. Thus, Madagascar’s “forest cats” are oceanic migrants from elsewhere – as with Madagascar’s other terrestrial mammals, albeit via a human source rather than natural
“rafting” processes
, such as the ancestors of Madagascar’s lemurs.
Study or eradicate?
What does this new information mean for these felids? Our results suggest Madagascar’s “forest cats” may have been introduced a millennium ago, and if so, studying their behaviour, biology and ecology provides a window into how exotic species adapt to island biogeography, as well as insight regarding
cat dispersals
.
Importantly, our findings also raise the questions of what these cats’ role is in Madagascar’s forest ecosystems. Should they be
eradicated
– at least from protected reserves – as has been done on other islands in terms of introduced species?
The conservation questions surrounding these new data are complex and require thoughtful conversation to understand the whole story of Madagascar’s “forest cats”."
For whom the bell tolls: cats kill more than a million Australian birds every day,https://theconversation.com/for-whom-the-bell-tolls-cats-kill-more-than-a-million-australian-birds-every-day-85084,"Cats kill more than a million birds every day across Australia, according to our new estimate – the first robust attempt to quantify the problem on a nationwide scale.
By combining data on the cat population, hunting rates and spatial distribution, we calculate that they kill 377 million birds a year. Rates are highest in Australia’s dry interior, suggesting that feral cats pose a serious and largely unseen threat to native bird species.

Ferals, strays, pets: how to control the cats that are eating our wildlife
This has been a contentious issue for more than 100 years, since the spread of feral cats encompassed the entire Australian mainland. In 1906 the ornithologist A.J. Campbell
noted
that the arrival of feral cats in a location often immediately preceded the decline of many native bird species, and he campaigned vigorously for action:
Undoubtedly, if many of our highly interesting and beautiful birds, especially ground-loving species, are to be preserved from total extinction, we must as a bird-lovers’ union, at no distant date face squarely a wildcat destruction scheme.
His call produced little response, and there has been no successful and enduring reduction in cat numbers since. Nor, until now, has there been a concerted effort to find out exactly how many birds are being killed by cats.
Counting the cost
To provide a first national assessment of the toll taken by cats on Australian birds, we have compiled almost 100 studies detailing the diets of Australia’s feral cats. The results show that the average feral cat eats about two birds every five days.
We then combined these statistics with
information about the population density of feral cats
, to create a map of the estimated rates of birds killed by cats throughout Australia.

We
conclude
that, on average, feral cats in Australia’s largely natural landscapes kill 272 million birds per year. Bird-kill rates are highest in arid Australia (up to 330 birds per square km per year) and on islands, where rates can vary greatly depending on size.
We also estimate (albeit with fewer data) that feral cats in human-modified landscapes, such as the areas surrounding cities, kill a further 44 million birds each year. Pet cats, meanwhile, kill about 61 million birds per year.
Overall, this amounts to more than 377 million birds killed by cats per year in Australia – more than a million every day.
Which species are suffering?
In a
related study
, we also compiled records of the bird species being killed by cats in Australia. We found records of cats killing more than 330 native bird species – about half of all Australia’s resident bird species. In natural and remote landscapes, 99% of the cat-killed birds are native species. Our results also show that cats are known to kill 71 of Australia’s 117 threatened bird species.
Birds that feed or nest on the ground, live on islands, and are medium-sized (60-300g) are most likely to be killed by cats.

It is difficult to put a million-plus daily bird deaths in context without a reliable estimate of the total number of birds in Australia. But our coarse assessment from many published estimates of local bird density suggests that there are
about 11 billion land birds in Australia
,
suggesting that cats kill about 3-4% of Australia’s birds each year.
However, particular species are hit much harder than others, and the population viability of some species (such as quail-thrushes, button-quails and ground-feeding pigeons and doves) is likely to be especially threatened.
Our tally of bird deaths is comparable to similar estimates for other countries. Our figure is lower than a
recent estimate for the United States
, and slightly higher than in
Canada
. Overall, bird killings by cats seem to greatly outnumber those
caused by humans
.
In Australia, cats are likely to significantly increase the extinction risk faced by some bird species. In many locations, birds face a range of interacting threats, with cat abundance and hunting success shown to increase in
fragmented bushland
, in areas with
high stocking rates
, and in places with
poorly managed fire regimes
, so cat impacts compound these other threats.
Belling the cat
What can be done to reduce the impact? The federal government’s
Threatened Species Strategy
recognises the threat posed by feral cats, albeit mainly on the basis of their
role in mammal extinctions
.
The threatened species strategy also prioritised efforts to control feral cats more intensively, eradicate them from islands with important biodiversity values, and to expand a national network of fenced areas that excludes feral cats and foxes.
But while fences can create important havens for many threatened mammals, they are much less effective for protecting birds. To save birds, cats will need to be controlled on a much broader scale.

The war on feral cats will need many different weapons
We should also remember that this is not just a remote bush problem.
Roughly half of Australia’s cats are pets
, and they also take a considerable toll on wildlife.
While recognising the many benefits of pet ownership, we should also work to reduce the detrimental impacts. Fortunately, there is
increasing public awareness of the benefits of not letting pet cats roam freely
. With such measures, cat owners can help to look after the birds in their own backyards, and hence contribute to conserving Australia’s unique wildlife.

Cats and dogs both like to play fetch − it’s rooted in their hunting instincts,https://theconversation.com/cats-and-dogs-both-like-to-play-fetch-its-rooted-in-their-hunting-instincts-237926,"Many people have seen dogs fetch, but cats like to get into the game too. Despite their very different hunting and play styles, fetching appears to combine elements of predatory and social behavior for both species.
Although their domestication histories and natural behaviors are very different, cats and dogs share many similarities. Both species are predators, live closely with humans and are capable of enjoying rich social experiences with us.
In our
newly published study
, we found that  more than 40% of cats described in our survey data played fetch, compared with almost 80% of dogs. We also outlined several possible reasons for fetching, including play, selection during domestication, and learning effects.
Fetching reinforces the bonds that dogs and cats form with humans.
Scant research
Our research group
sat up and took note when British researchers published a study in 2023 that explored some
key characteristics of fetching in cats
. The scientists surveyed 924 owners of cats that fetched, and they found that the cats would retrieve a wide variety of objects, from pet toys and balls of paper to pens, bottle caps
and even shoes
.
Perhaps most intriguing was the fact that the cats generally were not trained to fetch – they offered the behavior spontaneously. Cats also preferred to be the one to start the fetch game and were more likely to play when they brought a toy to their human, rather than the human tossing a toy.
Prior to this study, fetching behavior in cats hadn’t received much scientific attention. But because this review surveyed only owners of cats that fetched, there was no way to compare those animals with cats that didn’t. We wondered whether there was something about the cats themselves that made some more likely to fetch than others.
And what about dogs? Fetching is one of the
most common forms of play between dogs and humans
. Many dogs have been bred and selected specifically for assisting human hunts by
retrieving prey
. We expected to find abundant research about fetching behavior in dogs, but we learned that it was rarely addressed in dog behavior studies.
Fluffy, get the ball!
To help fill this gap, our group teamed with
University of Pennsylvania researcher James Serpell
, who developed two survey-based tools to assess dog and cat behavior. The surveys include basic questions about each animal’s breed, age and living environment, followed by dozens of questions about their behavior, including traits such as predatory behavior, sociability with humans, activity level and fearfulness. Both surveys also included questions about fetching.
Using these survey results, we analyzed data from thousands of cat and dog owners to explore just how common fetching is and what characteristics of a cat or dog and their environment are likely to predict fetching.
We found that fetching was much more common in cats than we anticipated. Over 40% of cat owners had a cat that “sometimes, usually, or always” fetched. For comparison, we also provided the first estimate of the prevalence of fetching behavior in dogs. Almost 78% of dogs represented in the data were reported to fetch.
Interestingly, being male was associated with increased fetching in both species. Being older and having health problems decreased the likelihood that either cats or dogs would be fetchers. And for both species, sharing a home with a dog also made the animal represented in the survey less likely to fetch.
There were breed differences too, especially among dogs. Breeds known for being responsive to human instructions and taking interest in toys, such as
German shepherd dogs
,
golden retrievers
and
Labrador retrievers
, were among the most likely breeds to fetch. In contrast, hounds and livestock guard dogs were among those least likely to fetch.
Fetching was correlated with trainability in dogs, regardless of breed, pointing to the potential importance of early selection of dogs to be human helpers,
long before we started developing dog breeds
.
There are far fewer breeds of cats than dogs, and fewer purebred cats were represented in our study compared with dogs. Still, we also found breed differences among cats.
Siamese
,
Tonkinese
,
Burmese
and
Bengals
were the most likely cats to fetch.
Fetching was correlated with activity level: Cats that were more likely to run, jump, engage with new items in the home and initiate play with their owners were also more likely to fetch.
From hunting to playing catch
The roots of fetching behavior lie in both species’ hunting practices. Cats are known as stalk-and-rush hunters, meaning that they sneak up on their prey and
pounce at an opportune moment
. Dogs are believed to be pursuit predators that
chase prey over longer distances
.
Development of breeds has altered dogs’ typical predatory behavior sequence, which goes like this: orient, eye, stalk, chase, grab-bite, kill-bite. Dog breeds that have been bred for exaggerated or increased “chase and/or grab-bite” behavior – such as pointers and retrievers – are more likely to fetch and less likely to complete the predatory sequence and “kill-bite.”
But both cats and dogs will carry prey items away from the kill site, which may also partially explain how a behavior such as fetch could arise.
Although cats often are viewed as independent and aloof, recent studies have found that cats can
show  attachment to humans
,
pick up social cues from humans
and even
recognize their owner’s voice
. We hope that our study further encourages people to understand that cats are capable of loving relationships with humans, especially when these popular pets are well socialized and provided with an enriched and safe environment. Including fetching, if your cat is so inclined.
For all of the differences between dogs and cats, we think it’s charming that they have converged on a similar behavior – fetching. Fetching also highlights the effect of the human-animal relationship. Humans clearly play an important role in fetching behavior, even if dogs and cats simply perceive us as the thing that makes the toy move so they can chase it."
Curious Kids: How can you tell if your cat is happy and likes you?,https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-how-can-you-tell-if-your-cat-is-happy-and-likes-you-82834,"This is an article from

How can you tell if your cat is happy and likes you? – Melissa, age 12, Melbourne
Hi Melissa, you’ve asked two great questions - I’ll take them one at a time.
First up, how can you tell if your cat is happy? Cats can’t tell us how they’re feeling, but if we watch their behaviour closely we can work out a lot.
Read more:
Curious Kids: Why do adults think video games are bad?
What things does your cat like doing? Does it have a favourite chair or ledge to sit on? Or a favourite window to look out of? Perhaps it likes sitting on your lap, or playing with toys? Most cats love to sleep in a warm place.
The things you see your cat doing are probably what it enjoys. As long as it gets the chance to do these things then your cat is probably happy. Providing lots of toys to play with is a great way to keep your cat happy, especially if it’s a kitten.
For example, you could make them a food puzzle - cats have a natural hunting instinct and like to hunt for their food. Find an empty water bottle and put holes around the body of the bottle. Then put some dry food in and put the lid on - as your cat moves the bottle around the food will fall out.

Curious Kids: Why don’t cats wear shoes?
Depending on their personality, cats can show they are unhappy in two ways.
The first kind of cat might hide away under a bed or in a cupboard, and show no interest in playing or interacting. If it also stops eating and grooming this is likely a sign that it’s not happy.
The second kind of cat might pace around, or seek your attention by meowing constantly. These cats might follow you around all of the time, and destroy furniture or other things in your house.
Some cats can also urinate in the wrong places when they are unhappy.
If your cat shows any of these signs it probably means there is something bothering it. If it’s not eating or cleaning itself, or there are other signs you’re worried about, then it might be a good idea to take it to the vet to see if there is anything wrong.
How can you tell if your cat likes you?
If your cat likes a cuddle on your lap and purrs when you pat it then it probably likes you. Cats will choose to hang around people they really like, the same as you do with your friends. If your cat likes being petted it will probably stay still, close its eyes, and move its head or body so that you rub its favourite places. This might be along the cheeks, under the chin, or between the ears and eyes.
However, if your cat doesn’t like these things, don’t panic that it doesn’t like you! Some cats are friendlier than others, and your cat might not like to be cuddled, the same way some people love hugs and others don’t. Your cat might still enjoy knowing that you’re around, even if it doesn’t want to come right up to you.

Cute and condemned to suffering: it’s time to ban the breeding of mutant cats,https://theconversation.com/cute-and-condemned-to-suffering-its-time-to-ban-the-breeding-of-mutant-cats-65874,"Cats are one of the world’s favourite pets, but in our efforts to breed more attractive felines, we are metaphorically loving them to death.
Like
British Bulldogs
and
extreme styles of pigeons
, some cats
bred to please a human sense of beauty
suffer from serious health problems. This is the case for a particularly lovely cat, the Scottish Fold.
It has long been known that breeding Scottish Folds risks health problems, but
research
is mounting that it is impossible to mitigate this risk. It is time to ban the breeding of this type of cat, as other nations have done.
Why so cute?
The
Scottish Fold
is a rare feline breed. It originated when a naturally occuring mutant cat was born in Scotland during the last century, at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire. The cat had forward-folding ears because her ear cartilage wasn’t rigid enough to support her ears.
Her name was Susie and she looked cute. Cute enough that, in a great UK tradition, they wanted to preserve the mutation by breeding her with British short-haired cats and local farm cats. And so the Scottish Fold was born.
Why do people like cats with floppy ears? Many authorities think this is because of the
Lorenzian theory of beauty
, named in honour of
Konrad Lorenz
who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on ethology, the study of animal behaviour.
Most people, especially children, find a round face resembling that of a human comforting, whereas the longer snout and erect ears (of, say, a wolf) is potentially frightening.  For this reason, many people find the appearance of owls pleasing to the eye, which is why they have
owl cafes in Tokyo
, and why so many people collect owl figurines.
So a Scottish Fold looks owl-like, and for many people this is a highly desirable trait.
Humans find the Scottish Fold’s owl-like face irresistable.

Tracing the mutation
It didn’t take long for veterinarians and scientists to figure out that if the cartilage in the ear was defective, then cartilage in the joints might also be dodgy. The British geneticist Oliphant Jackson demonstrated this unequivocally in a most elegant series of classic genetic and radiological experiments in a hospital basement in the 1970s.
Cats, like people, have two copies of most genes. Jackson showed that cats like Susie (and her daughter Snooks), which both had a single copy of the postulated defective gene, were reasonably normal.
In contrast, cats with two copies of the dud gene developed crippling arthritis from an early age. Sensibly, Jackson suggested the breeding of such cats be banned, and that’s what happened in the UK and France.
But some Scottish Folds were exported to the US. Unfortunately, in that jurisdiction breeding was allowed, with the proviso that a Scottish Fold only be mated to a Scottish Shorthair (a normal cat with a similar genetic background, but with normal ears and hence normal cartilage). This type of mating resulted in half of each litter of kittens (on average) having folded ears, the other half being Scottish Shorthairs. And so the breed went on.
In the early 1990s a group of Australian veterinarians demonstrated convincingly that all Scottish Fold cats have abnormal bone development of their distal limbs. This is generally associated with
early onset and accelerated progression of osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) in joints of the distal limbs and tail
.  The ankle and wrist were the joints most obviously affected, especially the ankles.
Scottish Folds often develop limb problems. A) shows a severely affected cat and b) a mildly affected cat.
Chris Simpson

In time all Folds develop adverse changes. This work was confirmed and extended subsequently by
Japanese
and
Korean
investigators. Yet Scottish Folds are still bred in the US, Asia and even Australia.
Two years ago a collaboration between Australian, European and American researchers uncovered the science behind the problem. Their research was recently published in the journal
Osteoarthritis and Cartilage
.
The problem lies in a gene that affects cells involved with pressure and pain sensing within cartilage.
Children with a very similar genetic defect
have comparable bone deformities to affected Scottish Fold cats.
What does this mean for the cats?
Scottish Shorthairs have normal ears and are completely healthy. They are lovely, sweet-natured cats.
Scottish Folds have shortened limbs, an abnormal gait, a peculiar and sometimes stiff or painful tail, and the propensity to develop osteoarthritis at an earlier age. This causes variable lameness (often severe) and secondary deformity.

The truth is, we have known since Jackson’s work in the 1970s that breeding Scottish Fold cats is ethically indefensible.
Yet the practice has continued in most jurisdictions, with cat breeders and veterinarians turning a blind eye to the frequently obvious problems.
While there are still questions to be answered, we already possess sufficient information to know that breeding these cats is cruel. Vets and cat breeders who condone this practice have no scientific basis with which to defend this practice. They are not breeding cats – they are perpetuating a disease state.
What to do
The breeding of Scottish Folds has been effectively
banned in Victoria
. It should be the same in every state of Australia and every country overseas.
In my opinion, the RPSCA should seek out people who advertise these cats for sale and prosecute them.
We cannot condone breeding cats because it’s in our nature to think they are cute, when pain and suffering will afflict a substantial proportion of these cats for much of their life, with ongoing requirements for medication and sometimes even
radiation therapy
or

and
pet cats
are responsible for a huge part of Australia’s shameful
mammal extinction
record. Small and medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals are most susceptible.
But we’ve found one mammal in particular that can outsmart cats and live alongside them: the long-nosed potoroo.

A season in hell: bushfires push at least 20 threatened species closer to extinction
These miniature kangaroo-like marsupials are
officially listed as vulnerable
. And after the recent devastating fires, extensive swathes of their habitat in southeastern Australia were severely burnt, leaving them
more exposed to predators
such as foxes and cats. But the true extent of the impact on their numbers remains unclear.
Amid the devastation, our
new study
is reason to be optimistic.
Long-nosed potoroos are a bit like mini kangaroos, but spend much of their time digging for fungi.
Zoos Victoria
Using motion-sensing camera traps on the wildlife haven of
French Island
– which is free of foxes, but not cats – we found potoroos may have developed strategies to avoid prowling cats, such as hiding in dense vegetation.
If these long-nosed potoroos can co-exist with one of the world’s most deadly predators, then it’s time we rethink our conservation strategies.
Surviving cats with a deadly game of hide and seek
We conservatively estimated that between five and 14 cats lived in our study area (but it takes
only one cat
to eradicate a population of native animals).
Although cats were common here, we detected them less often in areas of dense vegetation. By contrast, this was where we found potoroos more often.
French Island’s thick vegetation provides potoroos with critical refuge to evade feral cats.
Vivianna Miritis
Long-nosed potoroos are nocturnal foragers that mainly, but not exclusively, feed in more open habitat before sheltering in dense vegetation during the day. But we found potoroos rarely ventured out of their thick vegetation shelter.
This may be because they’re trading off potentially higher quality foraging habitat in more open areas against higher predation risk. In other words, it appears they’ve effectively learnt to hide from the cats.

Yes, kangaroos are endangered – but not the species you think
Another intriguing result from our study was that although potoroos and feral cats shared more than half of their activity time, the times of peak activity for each species differed.
Cats were active earlier in the night, while potoroo activity peaked three to four hours later. This might be another potoroo strategy to avoid becoming a cat’s evening meal.
Temporal activity of cats and long-nosed potoroos for winter and summer, on French Island, Victoria. Their overlap is represented by the area shaded in grey. Modified from Miritis et al. (2020).
Still, completely avoiding cats isn’t possible. Our study site was in the national park on French Island, and it’s likely cats saturate this remnant patch of long-nosed potoroo habitat.
It’s also possible cats may be actively searching for potoroos as prey, and indeed some of our camera images showed cats carrying young long-nosed potoroos in their mouths. These potoroos were more likely killed by these cats, rather than scavenged.
Cats are expert hunters
Cats are exceedingly difficult to manage effectively. They’re adaptable, elusive and have a preference for live prey.
The two most common
management practices for feral cats
are lethal control and exclusion fencing. Lethal control needs to be intensive and conducted over large areas to benefit threatened species.

And outside of predator-free sanctuaries, it must be ongoing. If control stops,
cats can reinvade from surrounding areas
.
“
Safe havens
” – created through the use of exclusion fencing or predator-free islands – can overcome some of these challenges. But while exclusion fencing is highly effective, it can create other bad outcomes, including an over-abundance of herbivores, leading to
excessive grazing of vegetation
.
Camera traps can tell us a lot about how introduced predators and native wildlife interact.
Zoos Victoria and Deakin University
Fencing and islands can result in native animals
rapidly losing their anti-predator behaviour
. This can limit the success of
reintroducing
them to areas outside predator-free havens.
In any case, removing introduced predators might not be really necessary in places native species can co-exist. If long-nosed potoroos have learnt to live with feral cats, we should instead focus on how to maintain their survival strategies.
Why cat eradication isn’t always the best option
It’s clear cats are here to stay, so we shouldn’t simply fall back largely on predator eradication or predator-free havens as the only way to ensure our wildlife have a fighting chance at long-term survival.
Yes, for some species, it’s vital to keep feral predators away. But for others like long-nosed potoroos, conserving and creating
suitable habitat and different vegetation densities
may be the best way to keep them alive.

But perhaps most important is having predator-savvy insurance populations, such as long-nosed potoroos on French Island. This is incredibly valuable for one day moving them to other areas where predators – native or feral – are present, such as nearby Phillip Island.
In the absence of predators, native wildlife can rapidly lose their ability to recognise predator danger. Programs aimed at eradicating introduced predators where they’re co-existing with native species need to pay careful attention to this."
Human catches COVID from a cat – here’s why this new evidence is not cause for panic,https://theconversation.com/human-catches-covid-from-a-cat-heres-why-this-new-evidence-is-not-cause-for-panic-186233,"Since the pandemic began, there have been several documented cases of humans transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19,
to their pets
. But the reverse has been rarer – until recently,
hamsters
,
mink
and
white-tailed deer
were the only animals reported to have spread SARS-CoV-2 to people.
Now, for the first time, a group of researchers in Thailand has demonstrated a likely case of transmission from
a cat
back to a human.
So should we be worried about the possibility of catching COVID from our pets? Probably not on the basis of this study. But there are areas where pet-to-human transmission could be a concern in the future.
Read more:
How we found coronavirus in a cat
The study reports that a father and his adult son,
who caught COVID in Bangkok
, were transported 900km to a hospital in the Hatyai district of Thailand because there were no hospital beds available in Bangkok. The patients travelled by ambulance together with their pet cat. There is no mention in the study as to why the cat was with them.
On arrival, the cat was examined by three local veterinarians and was swabbed for SARS-CoV-2. While the nasal swab was being taken, the cat sneezed in the face of one of the veterinarians. The test on the cat was positive and this veterinarian also became positive a few days later.
Careful sequencing of the virus from the father and son, from the cat and from the veterinarian showed that they were identical and, importantly, different from the strains circulating in the area around Hatyai. The very strong inference is that the father, son and cat had caught COVID in Bangkok, while the cat infected the veterinarian during the examination.
SARS-CoV-2 is already known to infect
a range of domestic and wild animals
including bats, cats, dogs, mink and deer. Based on comparing the receptors on the surface of the virus and on a range of animal cells, scientists predict that it could infect
many more species
if the opportunity arose.
But so far, the evidence has suggested that if animal-to-human transmission plays any part in maintaining the pandemic, it’s very minor. Locking down the human population has always been effective in reducing transmission, supporting the idea that human-to-human transmission is the most important factor.
Pet ownership hasn’t been identified as a risk factor for COVID. In one study
walking the dog
increased COVID risk, but this could of course be linked to a range of sources of infection.
In the Netherlands, where there was evidence of
mink-to-human transmission
, the mink were kept in cages where transmission between the mink was rife, and where the farm workers were heavily exposed to them.
Even in this latest study from Thailand, only one of the three veterinarians became infected – probably because the cat sneezed in her face. This would have exposed her to a high dose of virus. She was wearing a mask covering her mouth and nose, but not eye goggles or a face shield.
Pet ownership doesn’t generally increase your risk of COVID.

The
advice
from public health agencies during the pandemic so far has been to try to minimise your contact with your pet if you have COVID, and minimise any contact between your pet and other people and their pets. Overall, there seems to be no reason to change this advice.
Potential problems
There are concerns about the possibility that transmission through any non-human species might result in the evolution of
new, unpredictable variants
. These variants might, for example, be better able to escape immunity generated by vaccination or prior infections, or cause more serious disease.
In the Thailand case, as the authors hypothesise, the most obvious assumption is that the father and son contracted SARS-CoV-2 in Bangkok, transmitted it to their cat, and that the cat then infected the veterinarian. The similarity between the genetic sequence of the virus in all of them would suggest no mutations occurred in transit through the cat.
But another possible scenario is that the cat was infected first and subsequently transmitted the virus to its owners and then, independently, to the veterinarian. This is less likely because cats seem to shed SARS-CoV-2
for a shorter time
than humans, but it’s still possible.
If this had happened, it would be impossible to assess whether there had been any mutations in transit through the cat without comparing the sequence of the viruses from the father, son, cat and veterinarian to those circulating in Bangkok where the cat would, presumably, have become infected.
Read more:
COVID: what happens if a far more lethal coronavirus emerges in pets?
We have seen mutations to the virus occur
in mink-to-human transmission
. But culling of mink and isolation of humans prevented further transmission of these mutated versions of SARS-CoV-2, and the symptoms in people who became infected from mink weren’t any more severe than in those who caught the virus from other humans. In cats who have contracted SARS-CoV-2, mutations have occurred but, so far, there don’t seem to be
any consistent patterns
which might suggest a problem.
New SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping immunity or causing more severe disease could derail our progression to normality. At the moment, there’s little evidence that a cycle of human-to-cat, cat-to-cat or cat-to-human transmission (or a cycle involving any other pets) could contribute to the appearance of such variants in future.
That said, it’s important we maintain good surveillance mechanisms in humans, pets, livestock and wild animals to identify any changes in the SARS-CoV-2 virus which could lead to new variants of concern down the track."
"Wildcats lived alongside domestic cats for 2,000 years but only started interbreeding 60 years ago – new study",https://theconversation.com/wildcats-lived-alongside-domestic-cats-for-2-000-years-but-only-started-interbreeding-60-years-ago-new-study-216871,"You are unlikely to have seen one, but wildcats are still clinging on by a claw in Scotland. Most of the cats living in the wild in Scotland are hybrid cats with a mix of wildcat and domestic cat ancestry or feral domestic cats. But my team’s new study showed they lived alongside domestic cats for almost 2,000 years before interbreeding.
One of our rarest and most elusive mammal species, European wildcats
have been in decline
across across Europe and Britain for the past few hundred years. Wildcats were lost completely from England and Wales by the end of the 19th century and today are
only found in the Scottish Highlands
.
Habitat loss
and hunting are two of the biggest threats facing this species across its range, but in Scotland,
hybridisation with domestic cats
is now the biggest threat to this population. Interbreeding between the two species is frequent now.
This gradual erosion of the wildcat genome (
the DNA instructions
for everything that makes a wildcat a wildcat) may lead to the complete extinction of this species in Britain. Among scientists, this is known as
genetic swamping
.
How long has this been going on?
Although domestic cats and wildcats are different species, genetically more different than dogs and wolves, they look similar. Domestic cats,
descended from the African-Asian wildcat
, became widespread in Britain in Roman times.
Wildcats in Scotland are a subpopulation of European wildcats, and have been present in Britain
since the end of the last ice age
, around 10,000 years ago. Our research, which used the genomes of ancient cats from prehistoric Britain (around 6,000BC) until the present, shows that the two species kept themselves separate until very recently.
This may be expected for two species such as these, which have different patterns of behaviour and habitat preference. Wildcats keep away from people and prefer natural, forested areas – unlike domestic cats which thrive in human-modified environments.
My team’s study showed that around 60 years ago, however, there was a sudden shift to increasingly frequent interbreeding, which quickly overwhelmed the remaining wildcats in Scotland.
What changed?
The recent history of hybridisation between the two species strongly suggests that hybridisation is a symptom, rather than the cause, of wildcat declines in Britain.
Wildcats have been hunted for sport, and are also
persecuted as a pest species
which keeps their numbers down. Modern land management has involved the felling of
large swaths of Scottish forests
(often for timber or agriculture), potentially forcing wildcats into more human-dominated environments, where they are more likely to meet a domestic cat.
The 20th century also saw a rise in domestic cat ownership, which is now at an all-time high
in the UK
. While it can be hard to keep track of feral domestic cat numbers, the population size is likely to significantly outnumber the wildcat population.
Our study highlighted the pressure that disease transmission is putting on wildcat populations. Domestic cats are a known source of feline diseases, such as
feline immunodeficiency virus
,
feline calicivirus
and
haemoplasma infection
, which can be passed to wildcats, and can be deadly.
Wildcats look similar to domestic cats.

Our study compared the genomes of hybrid, wildcat and domestic cats. The hybrid population showed genetic patterns suggesting they are developing immunity to these diseases, with the help of genes inherited from domestic cat parents. While this may bring short-term protection from cat diseases, it results in domestic cat DNA hitching along for the ride, perhaps accelerating the effect of genetic swamping.
Without intervention, the few wildcats that remain will interbreed with domestic cats and the wildcat genome will contribute a fraction of a percent to the domestic cat genome. The biological and behavioural adaptations that evolved in the European wildcat will be lost.
Does this matter?
Human behaviour (such as transporting species around the world, encroachment on wild habitats and climate change) is driving an increase in hybridisation globally. Conservationists are debating the level of risk this poses to wildlife populations, and the best course of action for conservation management.

Hybrid future? Interbreeding can make heat-averse species more resilient to climate change
In some cases hybridisation can be beneficial, bringing new genetic diversity that can help species survive in increasingly human-dominated environments. However, the consequences of hybridisation are unpredictable, and it is hard to come up with a solution that works for every case.
For the wildcat, hybridisation is a double-edged sword. It brought disease resistance that aided the population’s short-term survival, but at the cost of threatening the genetic adaptations that made the species unique.
What next for wildcats?
My team’s study highlights the value of the
captive wildcat population
in the UK. First established in 1960, founders of this population largely predate the onset of hybridisation in Scotland. The captive population now provides an important lifeline to reestablish this species in Britain.
A wildcat conservation breeding for release programme is conducted by
Saving Wildcats
, a partnership led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The first releases into the wild started this year, with 19 cats released in the Cairngorms Connect area of the Cairngorms National Park.
Monitoring the newly released cats will give us vital insights about how to protect species like the wildcat. The more we understand about the effects and history of hybridisation, the more we’ll understand about how best to manage wildlife conservation in the future.

Fire-ravagedKangaroo Island is teeming with feral cats. It’s bad news for this little marsupial,https://theconversation.com/fire-ravaged-kangaroo-island-is-teeming-with-feral-cats-its-bad-news-for-this-little-marsupial-141201,"When I visited Kangaroo Island for the first time after the summer bushfires, I thought I knew what to expect. But what really hit me was the scale.
The wild western end of the island, once a vast mallee woodland peppered with wildflowers and mobs of roaming roos, had been completely erased. An immense dune field covered with sharp blackened sticks now stretched beyond the horizon, to the sea, hollow and quiet.
While fire is a fundamental process in many Australian ecosystems, the size and severity of this fire was extreme, and the impacts on the island’s wildlife has been immense.

For the many threatened species on Kangaroo Island, such as the critically endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart, their fight for survival still isn’t over.
High numbers of feral cats
roaming the landscape now pose a huge threat to their persistence, with little vegetation left within the fire scar to provide cover for wildlife.
In fact, our recent research found there are, on average, almost
double the number of cats
per square kilometre on Kangaroo Island than on the mainland.

The scale of the fires
Kangaroo Island is uniquely positioned, home to wildlife native to both eastern and western Australia. It protects nationally threatened species, such as the glossy black-cockatoo, the pygmy copperhead, Rosenberg’s goanna and the Kangaroo Island dunnart.
The recent bushfires on Kangaroo Island were the largest ever recorded there, destroying swathes of habitat. Over a period of 49 days the fire burnt 211,255 hectares, impacting almost
half of the island
, particularly the western and central regions.
For the critically endangered Kangaroo Island dunnart, the fires burnt
approximately 95%
of the
species’ known habitat
and left them on the brink of extinction.
Dunnarts face extinction
The Kangaroo Island dunnart is a small carnivorous marsupial weighing about 20 grams, with soft sooty fur and dark eyes. The species eats mainly insects, and shelters in hollow logs and in the skirts of grass trees.
Even prior to the fire the species was considered likely to become extinct in the
next 20 years
. Despite extensive survey efforts, the dunnart had only been seen at 19 sites on Kangaroo Island between 1990 and 2019.
Our own survey work between 2017 and 2018 confirmed the persistence of the dunnart at just
six sites in the national park
, with Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife detecting several additional records on private land. All sites were in the western half of the island where the recent fires burned.
Many dunnarts are likely to have died in the fire itself, but individuals that survived are left extremely vulnerable to starvation and feral cat predation.
Cats roaming the island in big numbers
Between
two and six million
feral cats are estimated to live in Australia, and collectively kill more than
three billion animals
per year.

The problem is so large, a
parliamentary inquiry
is, for the first time in 30 years, investigating the impact of feral and domestic cats to native wildlife.
What’s more, in some areas on Kangaroo Island where the availability of animal carcasses is high, the density of feral cats is more than ten times as high as mainland estimates.
There are twice as many cats per square kilometre on Kangaroo Island than on mainland Australia.

A high cat density poses a formidable threat to wildlife survival during the post-fire period, because cats will sometimes travel large distances to
hunt within recent fire scars
. Research is underway on the island to examine exactly how the fires have changed cat densities and hunting behaviour in and around burnt areas.
How to control feral cats
Controlling feral cats is one of the biggest challenges in Australian conservation. Cats are cryptic and cautious, hard to find, see, trap and remove.
Despite the challenge, a large-scale feral cat eradication is underway on Kangaroo Island. This is the largest island on which cat eradication has ever been attempted, and the project will take years.
Read more:

In the meantime, feral cats are being controlled around the last refuges for Kangaroo Island dunnarts. There are multiple methods for this including shooting and cage trapping, but in remote areas that are hard to access, poison-baiting is likely to be an effective, long-term strategy.
Most feral cat baits are meat-based, but our research shows possums and bush rats are still
likely to consume them
.
Therefore, researchers have worked for many years on strategies to minimise the potential impacts of feral cat baits on native wildlife. For example, the poison can be delivered within a hard plastic pellet, inside the meat bait.
Field trials have indicated that while cats swallow portions of this bait whole, ingesting the pellet, most native wildlife will chew around and
discard the pellet
.
Hope emerges after huge survey effort
Despite the gravity of the risk to Kangaroo Island wildlife, there is hope. A huge, dedicated and effective survey effort by both government and non-government organisations has resulted in the detection of Kangaroo Island dunnarts at more than 22 sites.

Many of these populations appear to be very small and isolated. And now, more than ever, they’re extremely vulnerable. Targeted cat control and/or protection of vulnerable populations with exclusion fencing may be the only way to prevent their extinction.
By controlling cats, we can help native species like the Kangaroo Island dunnart get through this difficult time, and continue to fulfil their place in that wild landscape for years to come.

Why cats meow at humans more than each other,https://theconversation.com/why-cats-meow-at-humans-more-than-each-other-232865,"This is a story that goes back thousands of years.
Originally, cats were solitary creatures. This means they preferred to live and hunt alone, rather than in groups. Most of their social behaviour was restricted to mother-kitten interactions. Outside of this relationship, cats
rarely meow
at each other.
However, as cats began to live alongside humans, these vocalisations took on new meanings. In many ways, when a cat meows at us, it’s as if they see us as their caregivers, much like their feline mothers.
Cats probably first
encountered humans
roughly
10,000 years ago
, when people began establishing permanent settlements. These settlements attracted rodents, which in turn drew cats looking for prey. The less fearful and more adaptable cats thrived, benefiting from a consistent food supply. Over time, these cats developed closer bonds with humans.
Unlike dogs, which were bred by humans for specific traits, cats essentially
domesticated themselves
. Those that could tolerate and communicate with humans had a survival advantage, leading to a population well-suited to living alongside people.
To understand this process, we can look at Russian farmed fox experiments. Beginning in the 1950s, Soviet scientist
Dmitry Belyaev
and his team selectively bred silver foxes, mating those that were less fearful and aggressive toward humans.
Over generations, these foxes became more docile and friendly, developing physical traits similar to domesticated dogs, such as floppy ears and curly tails. Their
vocalisations
changed too, shifting from aggressive “coughs” and “snorts” to more friendly “cackles” and “pants”, reminiscent of human laughter.
These experiments demonstrated that selective breeding for tameness could lead to a range of behavioural and physical changes in animals, achieving in a few decades what would usually take thousands of years. Though less obvious than the differences between dogs and the ancestral wolf, cats have also changed since their days as African wildcats. They now have
smaller brains
and more
varied coat colours
, traits common among many domestic species.
Cats’ vocal adaptations
Like the silver foxes, cats have adapted their vocalisations, albeit over a much longer period of time. Human babies are altricial at birth, meaning they are entirely dependent on their parents. This dependency has made us
particularly attuned
to distress calls – ignoring them would be costly for human survival.
This owner looks like he would struggle to ignore his cat’s distress call.
Magui RF/Shutterstock
Cats have altered their vocalisations to tap into this sensitivity. A 2009 study by animal behaviour researcher
Karen McComb and her team
gives evidence of this adaptation. Participants in the study listened to two types of purrs. One type was recorded when cats were seeking food (solicitation purr) and another recorded when they were not (non-solicitation purr). Both cat owners and non-cat owners rated the solicitation purrs as more urgent and less pleasant.
An acoustic analysis revealed a high-pitch component in these solicitation purrs, resembling a cry. This hidden cry taps into our innate sensitivity to distress sounds, making it nearly impossible for us to ignore.
But it’s not just cats that have adapted their vocalisations: we have too. When we talk to babies, we use
“motherese”
, more commonly known as “baby talk”, characterised by a higher pitch, exaggerated tones and simplified language. This form of speech helps engage infants, playing a role in their
language development
.
We’ve extended this style of communication to our interactions with pets, known as pet-directed speech. Recent research suggests that cats respond to this form of communication. A 2022 study by animal behaviour researcher
Charlotte de Mouzon and colleagues
found that cats could distinguish between speech addressed to them and speech addressed to adult humans. This pattern of discrimination was particularly strong when the speech came from the cats’ owners.
Our adoption of pet-directed speech reinforces a bond that mirrors mother-kitten interactions.
Changes in vocalisations are not only seen in cat-human relationships. Compared to the ancestral wolf, dogs have
expanded their barking behaviour
to communicate more effectively with humans and, just as with cats, we use pet-directed speech when interacting with dogs.
Over time, cats have evolved to use vocal signals that resonate with our nurturing instincts. Paired with our use of pet-directed speech, this two-way communication highlights the unique relationship we’ve developed with our feline friends. It seems cats might be the winners in this relationship, adapting to solicit care and attention from us. Still, a lot of cat owners wouldn’t have it any other way."
Do cats purr when humans aren’t around?,https://theconversation.com/do-cats-purr-when-humans-arent-around-80216,"Why do cats purr? Humans tend to think that purring is a sign of happiness in a cat – and indeed it can be – but there are other reasons why our feline friends produce this particular vocalisation.
Purring is a habit that develops very early in a cat’s life, while suckling from its mother, so clearly it is not a sound that is directed solely at humans. Cat owners will be well aware that a cat can produce more than one kind of purr, just as they have a whole repertoire of meows, chirps, growls, spits and other sounds.
The purr that is produced during suckling, is quite different in quality to the purr that you will hear when your cat is sprawling across your lap being stroked.
Analysis of the sound
has shown when a cat is asking for food, whether from its mother or a human – the purr contains a high-pitched note that is similar in frequency to a cry (though not as loud). It may have something of the effect of the cry of a newborn, which affects the hormonal state of female mammals and
elicits a care-giving response
.
When a cat is being petted or is snuggled up to its owner on the sofa, the purr it produces is much more soporific and generally soothing, and acoustic analysis shows that
the “cry” component is missing
.
Adult cats will often purr when they are close to or in
physical contact
with another cat, engaging in grooming for example. They will also do it when they play with an inanimate object, or while eating, which can be at a time when they are alone. However, the most usual time for purring is in company, and it can be the care soliciting sound, asking to be fed or stroked, or an indication of social pleasure.
Cats often purr whilst grooming one another.

The darker side
Strangely, vets also report that cats will purr when they are in
great pain
or just before death. This seems to be illogical if it is a sound relating to pleasure, but in fact, it could be that the cat is asking for help.
It could also be a way of masking the fact that the cat is injured and vulnerable. If you are a small animal, even a carnivore, it is not good to show weakness as this could encourage larger predators to come along and eat you. The purr may be the cat equivalent of “everything’s fine, I’m on top of the world. Nothing to see here, move along please”.
Can big cats purr too?
There has long been a debate about whether the “big cats” can purr – and the belief has been that cats that roar, such as lions and tigers, cannot purr. Although there is no conclusive evidence on this subject, it seems that even cats that roar
purr as cubs
while suckling.
It is suggested that cheetahs may purr too.

All mammals have a bone or series of bones in the throat called the hyoid apparatus, which supports the larynx and tongue. In cat species that roar the
hyoid apparatus is not entirely made of bone
but retains some parts as cartilage, while cat species that purr have a hyoid that is completely bony. This modification may permit roaring, but does not necessarily mean that purring is impossible. It is believed that cheetah, ocelot, margay, serval, and lynx, among other species, can purr, and it is suggested that
jaguar, leopard, lion and tiger
cannot – or if they can they’ve kept it secret all these years.
Process behind the purr
The actual process of
producing the purring sound
is complicated, and is still not completely understood, but it involves the muscles of the larynx and the diaphragm being activated by bursts of nerve activity that originate in the brain and occur 20 to 30 times every second. This happens on both in and out breaths, which accounts for the continuous sound of the purr.
The fact that a cat can do all this and simultaneously eat, knead the cushions, rip the chair leg to pieces or weave complicated patterns through your legs without getting stepped on makes one wonder what they would have achieved with opposable thumbs."
Curious Kids: Why don’t cats wear shoes?,https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-dont-cats-wear-shoes-75308,"This is an article from
Curious Kids
, a new series for children. The Conversation is asking kids to send in questions they’d like an expert to answer. All questions are welcome – serious, weird or wacky!
Why don’t cats wear shoes?
– Molly, 3, Melbourne.
Cats don’t need shoes because since the dawn of time they have evolved to walk, run and jump on their hands and feet. Their hands and feet have evolved for the life of a carnivore (a meat-eater). They are well-designed killing machines, which is why we should try to keep pet cats inside.
Cats evolved in hot desert regions, where there were lots of small animals they could eat – mainly rodents like mice and rats. Hunters such as cats need to travel very fast, for short distances, to pounce on their prey, and to be able to climb so they can catch things that climb trees.
So they evolved to have retractable claws. That means cats can push them out and pull them in, just like Wolverine.
This slow-motion video shows how cats extend and retract their claws.
When they are resting, cats have their claws pulled in. These retractable claws help them grab and hold prey. They also help with climbing. They have a “thumb” on their front paws, which they use to scratch enemies in a fight, and to grip their prey so that cannot escape.
All members of the cat family – from little house cats to big panthers – have retractable claws.
Cats do not have “thumbs” on their hindlimbs (the back legs). The claws on a cat’s back legs are used mainly in climbing, and are not honed as much as those on the front legs.
This is our cat Obi’s paw from underneath. In this picture, we have made the claws pop out by gently pulling Obi’s paw. Claws are made of layers of keratin and sharpened to a knife’s edge.

Cats’ needle-sharp claws grow out of bones in their paws, just like our nails grow out of our finger bones. And cats use wooden objects in nature to sharpen their claws on their front paws. It’s instinctive – that means they can’t help wanting to do it.
Obi’s paw from underneath. The dark, black ‘stopper pad’ is in the middle and there are smaller ‘digital pads’ up on his ‘toes’. These are the shock absorbers, and the skin there is thicker and tougher than the rest of the cat’s skin. The cat is relaxed and so the claws are retracted (pulled in).

Some people like to ask their vet to remove the claws, but fortunately this cruel practice is banned in most places (including Australia). That’s because it hurts cats, messes with their fine balance, and affects their behaviour.
Another thing people sometimes do is use plastic protective caps to cover the claws. These are applied using superglue, to “save the furniture”. But an indoor “cat tree”, like a scratching post, works even better, and is less inconvenient for the cat.
The pads on their paws are shock absorbers, which helps explain why cats are so good at landing when they jump from a great height.
Parts of a cat’s paws are padded, and act as shock absorbers when they jump from great heights.
Some parts of the pads on the cat’s paws get their toughness through thickness and that protects them from rough surfaces. They also have special cushioning to protect against deformation.
Big cats like tigers also have well-designed paws that help them hunt, climb and jump.

If cats wore shoes, none of this – the climbing, grasping, catching and all the other things cats evolved to do to survive – would be possible. It would be like Wolverine wearing boxing gloves. It just wouldn’t work.
On the other hand, because they do not wear gloves and boots, cats can get infections from germs that live in the soil. This doesn’t happen often.
Of the animals we are most familiar with, only people and horses often wear shoes. Some people think it is silly for humans to be wearing shoes. It’s just an un-natural adaption to recent things like living in cities and walking on concrete.
So perhaps the answer to Molly’s question is: “Why do humans wear shoes?”

Earliest evidence of cat domestication found in China,https://theconversation.com/earliest-evidence-of-cat-domestication-found-in-china-21552,"There has been much
debate
about how cats went from hunting in the wild to a much-loved pet. That is because we know little about their domestication. Now researchers have found the earliest case of cat domestication, which happens to be in China, along with the first direct evidence of how it may have happened.
The oldest record of a cat’s association with humans comes from Cyprus where, about 9,500 years ago, a young wildcat was buried with a human. Egyptian art and cat mummies reveal that, by 4,000 years ago, cats had become loved pets. So it is clear that domestication happened in between these two dates. But many questions remains: how, where and when did it happen?
In a new study, just published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, Yaowu Hu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fiona Marshall of Washington University in St Louis, and their colleagues try to answer those questions. “We have never before been able to show the nature of the relationship that resulted in domestication, especially for an animal that is solitary like cats and so rare in archaeological sites. So it was surprising to be able to document this at all,” Marshall said.
Like most evolutionary adaptations, domestication of animals can happen in multiple ways. A mutually-beneficial relationship can drive small changes that lead to a permanent change in behaviour, with or without direct human meddling. Or it could be that a prey’s numbers dwindled because of excessive hunting, which forced humans to come up with smarter animal management ideas, such as herding, that led to domestication.
The latter happened to sheep, goats and cattle. The former it was thought must have happened to cats, dogs and pigs. And thanks to Hu and Marshall, we now have evidence in case of cats. It comes from Quanhucun, a site in central China, that was a human settlement about 6,000 years ago. Archaeologists have discovered houses, storage pits, pottery, and some floral and faunal remains there, but few human burials. Piecing all the evidence together makes a compelling case for how domestication of cats may have happened.
The floral remains show that the settlement cultivated millet on a large scale. And the faunal remains of cats, dogs, deer and other animals tell us what these animals present at the site ate.
The isotopes in bones can tell us how old they are, but the ratio of carbon and nitrogen isotopes can also reveal an animal’s diet. These bones were about 5,300 years old. The dietary analysis showed that dogs, pigs and rodents mostly ate millet, and, not surprisingly, cats mostly hunted animals that ate millet (probably rodents). The archaeological dig revealed a rodent burrow near a storage pit, which meant farmers had a rodent problem, something that cats could help with.
“Cats were probably brought into the human environment by farming and the rodents and other food available to them in farming villages,” Marshall said. “This might have made it possible to domesticate an animal that was nocturnal and not social.”
There are other clues that show that humans had a closer relationship with the felids. The remains of one cat indicate that it got more nutrition from millet than it did by hunting, which may mean that humans fed the cat. Hu and Marshall also found a cat bone that showed it had survived well into its old age, again indicating that humans may have cared for the animal, allowing it to live longer.
Not now. My domestication story is very long.
mobilestreetlife
There is one problem that has left Marshall perplexed. Most cats today are the
descendants
of
Felis silvestris lybica
, or the Near Eastern Wildcat. But Marshall cannot be certain that Quanhucun cats belong to that lineage, because they could not find enough DNA data to probe lineages. “That is the main limitation of the paper – the uncertainty of the cat species,” Hu said.
Comparison of Hu and Marshall’s data with that of domesticated cats shows that Quanhucun cats were domesticated or very close to being domesticated. However, without evidence of the lineage, we cannot be certain that what happened in Quanhucun ended up producing all modern domesticated cats."
"Cats don’t avoid strangers who behave badly towards their owners, unlike dogs",https://theconversation.com/cats-dont-avoid-strangers-who-behave-badly-towards-their-owners-unlike-dogs-155319,"There’s an old stereotype about the difference between cats and dogs. Dogs are loving and fiercely loyal, they say, while cats are aloof and indifferent. Most cat people probably disagree – I certainly find it hard to believe, with my cat purring away in my lap, that she doesn’t care about me.
Overall, cat cognition research suggests cats do form emotional bonds with their humans. Cats seem to
experience separation anxiety
, are more responsive
to their owners’ voices
than to strangers’ and
look for reassurance
from their owners in scary situations.
But
a new study
, by researchers in Japan, complicates the picture of our relationship with cats. Adapting a method previously used to study dogs, the researchers found cats – unlike dogs – don’t avoid strangers who refuse to help their owners.
Research suggests cats do form emotional bonds with their humans.

In the experiment, a cat watched as her owner tried to open a box to get at something inside. Two strangers sat on either side of the owner and the owner turned to one of them and asked for help. In “helper” trials, the stranger helped the owner to open the box. In “non-helper” trials, the stranger refused. The other stranger sat passively, doing nothing.
Then, both strangers offered the cat a treat, and the scientists watched to see which the cat approached first. Did she prefer to take food from a helper over a passive bystander? This would indicate a positivity bias, showing the helpful interaction made the cat feel more warmly towards the stranger. Or did she avoid taking food from the non-helper? This negativity bias might mean the cat felt distrustful.
When this method was
used to test dogs
, they showed a clear negativity bias. The dogs preferred not to take food from a stranger who refused help to their owner. In contrast, the cats in the new study were completely indifferent. They showed no preference for the helpful person and no avoidance of the unhelpful person. Apparently, as far as cats are concerned, food is food.

The curious character of cats – and whether they are really more aloof
Social cues
What should we take from this? A tempting conclusion would be that cats are selfish and couldn’t care less how their humans are treated. Although this might fit with our preconceptions about cats, it’s an example
of anthropomorphic bias
. It involves interpreting cats’ behaviour as though they were furry little humans, rather than creatures with their own distinctive ways of thinking.
To really understand cats, we have to get out of this human-centred mindset and think of them as cats. When we do, what seems most likely isn’t that the cats in this study were selfish, but they weren’t able to pick up on the social interactions between the humans. They weren’t aware that some of the strangers were being unhelpful.
Dogs evolved from pack animals.

Although cats are able to pick up on some human social cues – they can
follow human pointing
and are
sensitive to human emotions
– they’re probably less tuned in to our social relationships than dogs are.
Cats were domesticated more recently, and have been changed by domestication far less than dogs. While dogs are descended from social pack animals, cats’ ancestors were largely solitary hunters. Domestication has probably heightened dogs’ existing social skills, but it may not have done the same for cats, who were less socially aware to begin with. So we shouldn’t be too quick to conclude our cats don’t care if people are mean to us. What’s more likely is that they just can’t tell.
Despite their popularity, we still know relatively little about
how cats think
. Future research might show cats’ understanding of humans is even more limited than we currently realise. Alternatively, it might turn out that cats are better able to recognise human social dynamics in different contexts.
But whatever studies reveal, we should avoid letting preconceptions or anthropomorphism drive our interpretation of cats’ behaviour. Before we judge our feline friends to be indifferent or selfish, we should first try to look at the world through their eyes."
Don’t blame cats for destroying wildlife – shaky logic is leading to moral panic,https://theconversation.com/dont-blame-cats-for-destroying-wildlife-shaky-logic-is-leading-to-moral-panic-138710,"A number of conservationists claim cats are a
zombie apocalypse for biodiversity
that need to be removed from the outdoors by “
any means necessary
” – coded language for shooting, trapping and poisoning. Various media outlets have
portrayed cats
as
murderous superpredators
. Australia has even declared an official
“war” against cats
.
Moral panics emerge when people perceive an existential threat to themselves, society or the environment. When in the grip of a
moral panic
, the ability to think clearly and act responsibly is compromised. While the
moral panic over cats
arises from valid concerns over threats to native species, it obscures the real driver: humanity’s exploitative treatment of the natural world. Crucially, errors of scientific reasoning also underwrite this false crisis.
The (shaky) case against cats
Conservationists
and the
media
often claim that cats are a main contributor to a
mass extinction
, a catastrophic loss of species due to human activities, like habitat degradation and the killing of wildlife.
As an interdisciplinary team of scientists and ethicists studying animals in conservation,
we examined this claim
and found it wanting. It is true that like any other predator, cats can suppress the populations of their prey. Yet the extent of this effect is ecologically complex.
The potential impact of cats differs between
urban environments, small islands and remote deserts
. When
humans denude regions of vegetation
, small animals are particularly at risk from cats because they have no shelter in which to hide.
In a 2019 study, cat remains were found in 19.8% of coyote scat.
jhayes44/E+ via Getty Images
Small animals are similarly vulnerable when humans kill apex predators that
normally would suppress cat densities and activity
. For instance, in the U.S., cats are a
favorite meal for urban coyotes
, who
moderate feline impact
; and in Australia,
dingoes hunt wild cats
, which relieves pressure on native small animals.
Add in contrary evidence and the case against cats gets even shakier. For instance, in some ecological contexts,
cats contribute to the conservation of endangered birds
, by preying on
rats and mice
. There are also
documented cases of coexistence
between cats and native prey species.
The fact is, cats play
different predatory roles
in
different natural and humanized landscapes
. Scientists cannot assume that because cats are a problem for some wildlife in some places, they are a problem in every place.
Faulty scientific reasoning
In our
most recent publication
in the journal Conservation Biology, we examine an error of reasoning that props up the moral panic over cats.
Scientists do not simply collect data and analyze the results. They also establish a logical argument to explain what they observe. Thus, the reasoning behind a factual claim is equally important to the observations used to make that claim. And it is this reasoning about cats where claims about their threat to global biodiversity founder. In our analysis, we found it happens because many scientists take specific, local studies and overgeneralize those findings to the world at large.
Even when specific studies are good overall, projecting the combined “results” onto the world at large can cause unscientific overgeneralizations, particularly when
ecological context is ignored
. It is akin to pulling a quote out of context and then assuming you understand its meaning.
Ways forward
So how might citizens and scientists chart a way forward to a more nuanced understanding of cat ecology and conservation?
First, those examining this issue on all sides can acknowledge that both the well-being of cats and the survival of threatened species are legitimate concerns.
Second, cats, like any other predator, affect their ecological communities. Whether that impact is good or bad is a complex value judgment, not a scientific fact.
Third, there is a need for a more rigorous approach to the study of cats. Such an approach must be mindful of the importance of ecological context and avoid the pitfalls of faulty reasoning. It also means resisting
the siren call of a silver (lethal) bullet
.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Yet there are many options to consider. Protecting apex predators and their habitat is fundamental to enabling
threatened species to coexist with cats
. In some cases, people may choose to segregate domestic cats from vulnerable wildlife: for instance, with
catios
where cats can enjoy the outdoors while being kept apart from wildlife. In other cases, unhomed cats may be managed with
trap-neuter-return programs
and
sanctuaries
.
Finally, contrary to the framing of some scientists and journalists, the dispute over cats is not primarily about the science. Rather, it evokes an
ongoing debate
over the ethics that ought to guide humanity’s relationship with other animals and nature.
This is the root of the moral panic over cats: the struggle to move beyond treating other beings with domination and control, toward fostering a relationship rooted in
compassion and justice

What owning a cat does to your brain (and theirs),https://theconversation.com/what-owning-a-cat-does-to-your-brain-and-theirs-264396,"Cats may have a reputation for independence, but emerging research suggests we share a unique connection with them – fuelled by brain chemistry.
The main chemical involved is oxytocin, often called the love hormone. It’s the same neurochemical that surges when a mother cradles her baby or when friends hug,
fostering trust and affection
. And now studies are showing oxytocin is important for cat-human bonding too.
Read more:
Your dog can read your mind – sort of
Oxytocin plays a central role in social bonding, trust and stress regulation in many animals, including humans. One
2005 experiment
showed that oxytocin made human volunteers significantly more willing to trust others in financial games.
Oxytocin also has calming effects in humans and animals, as it suppresses the stress hormone cortisol and activates the
parasympathetic nervous system
(the rest and digest system) to help the body
relax
.
Scientists have long known that friendly interactions
trigger oxytocin release
in both dogs and their owners, creating a mutual
feedback loop of bonding
. Until recently, though, not much was known about its effect in cats.
Cats are more subtle in showing affection. Yet their owners often report the same warm feelings of companionship and stress relief that dog owners do – and studies are increasingly backing these reports up. Researchers in Japan, for example,
reported in 2021
that brief petting sessions with their cats boosted oxytocin levels in many owners.
In that study, women interacted with their cats for a few minutes while scientists measured the owners’ hormone levels. The results suggested that friendly contact (stroking the cat, talking in a gentle tone) was linked to elevated oxytocin in the humans’ saliva, compared with a quiet resting period without their cat.
Many people find petting a purring cat is soothing, and research indicates it’s not just because of the soft fur. The act of petting and even the sound of purring can trigger oxytocin release in our brains.
One 2002 study
found this oxytocin rush from gentle cat contact helps lower cortisol (our stress hormone), which in turn can reduce blood pressure and even pain.
Snuggling with a cat can help suppress the stress hormone cortisol.

When is oxytocin released between cats and humans?
Research is pinpointing specific moments that cause the release of this hormone in our cross-species friendship. Gentle physical contact seems to be a prime trigger for cats.
A February 2025 study
found that when owners engaged in relaxed petting, cuddling or cradling of their cats, the owners’ oxytocin tended to rise, and so did the cats’ – if the interaction was not forced on the animal.
The researchers monitored oxytocin in cats during 15 minutes of play and cuddling at home with their owner. Securely attached cats who initiated contact such as lap-sitting or nudging showed an oxytocin surge. The more time they spent close to their humans, the greater the boost.
What about less-cuddly felines? The same study noted different patterns in cats with more anxious or aloof attachment styles. Avoidant cats (those who kept their distance) showed no significant oxytocin change, while cats who were anxious (constantly seeking their owner but easily overwhelmed by handling) had high oxytocin to begin with.
Oxytocin of avoidant and anxious cats was found to drop after a forced cuddle. When interactions respect the cat’s comfort, the oxytocin flows – but when a cat feels cornered, the bonding hormone is elusive.
Maybe humans could learn something from their feline friends on managing attachment styles. The key to bonding with a cat is understanding how they communicate.
Unlike dogs, cats don’t rely on prolonged eye contact to bond. Instead, they use more understated signals. The most well known is the slow blink. It’s a feline smile,
signalling safety
and trust.
Purring also plays a role in bonding with people. The low-frequency rumble of a cat’s purr has been linked not only to healing in cats themselves, but also to
calming effects in humans
. Listening to purring can lower heart rate and blood pressure; oxytocin
mediates these benefits
.
The companionship of a cat, reinforced by all those
little oxytocin boosts
from daily interactions, can serve as a buffer against anxiety and depression –
in some cases
providing comfort on par with human social support.

Is your cat vocal or quiet? The explanation could be in their genes
Are cats just less loving than dogs?
It’s true that studies generally find stronger oxytocin responses in dog–human interactions. In
one widely discussed 2016 experiment
, scientists measured oxytocin in pets and owners before and after ten minutes of play. Dogs showed an average 57% spike in oxytocin levels after playtime, whereas cats showed about a 12% increase.
In humans, oxytocin levels rise during meaningful social interactions.
Studies
show that contact with a loved one produces stronger oxytocin responses than contact with strangers. So, a happy dog greeting is akin to that rush of seeing your child or partner.
Dogs, being pack animals domesticated for constant human companionship,
are almost hard-wired
to seek eye contact, petting and approval from us – behaviour that stimulates oxytocin release in both parties. Cats, however, evolved from more
solitary hunters
which didn’t need overt social gestures to survive. So, they may not display oxytocin-fueled behaviour as readily or consistently. Instead, cats may reserve their oxytocin-releasing behaviour for when they truly feel safe.
A cat’s trust isn’t automatic; it must be earned. But once given, it is reinforced by the same chemical that bonds human parents, partners and friends.
So, next time your cat blinks slowly from across the sofa or climbs on to your lap for a purr-filled cuddle, know that something invisible is happening too: oxytocin is rising in both your brains, deepening the trust and soothing the stress of daily life. Cats, in their own way, have tapped into the ancient biology of love."
Ancient DNA reveals how cats conquered the world,https://theconversation.com/ancient-dna-reveals-how-cats-conquered-the-world-79584,"Humans may have had pet cats for as long as 9,500 years. In 2004, archaeologists in Cyprus found
a complete cat skeleton
buried in a Stone Age village. Given that Cyprus has no native wildcats, the animal (or perhaps its ancestors) must have been brought to the island by humans all those millennia ago.
Yet despite our long history of keeping pet cats and their
popularity today
, felines aren’t the easiest of animals to domesticate (as anyone who’s felt a cat’s cold shoulder might agree). There is also little evidence in the archaeological record to show how cats became our friends and went on to spread around the world.
Now a new DNA study published in
Ecology and Evolution
suggests how cats may have followed the development of Western civilisation along land and sea trade routes. This process was eventually helped by a more concerted breeding attempt in the 18th century, creating the much-loved domestic short-haired or “tabby” cat we know today.
While the origin of the domesticated cat is still a mystery, it seems likely the process of becoming pets took a very long time. It seems that, because cats are so
independent, territorial
and, at times, downright antisocial, they were not so easy to domesticate as the co-operative, pack-orientated wolf.
It’s likely
that cats lived around humans for many centuries before succumbing to the lure of the fire and the cushion, and coming in from the cold to become true companions to humans.
The ancestors of today’s domestic cats encountered and interbred with various wildcat species.
Ottoni et al., 2017/Nature
,

The cat found in Cyprus corresponds to the Neolithic period of around 10,000 BC to 4,000 BC and the
agricultural revolution
. This was when people were beginning to settle down and become farmers instead of carrying on the nomadic hunter-gatherer existence that humans had followed for the previous 200,000 years or so. An
earlier DNA study
of other ancient remains confirms that domestic cats first emerged in what archaeologists call the Near East, the land at the eastern end of the Mediterranean where some of the first human civilisations emerged.
Of course, farming brings its own problems, including infestations of rats and mice, so perhaps it’s not surprising that it is at this time that we see the first occurrence of a cat
buried in a human grave
. It’s not hard to imagine that early farmers might have encouraged cats to stay around by helping them out with food during lean times of the year, and allowing them to come into their houses.
The gaps in the archaeological record mean that, after the Cyprus remains, evidence for domestic cats doesn’t appear again for thousands of years. More cat graves then
start to appear
among ancient Egyptian finds (although there is
also evidence
for tame cats in Stone Age China). It was in Egypt that cats really got their furry paws under the table and became not just part of the family but objects of religious worship.
To track the spread of the domestic cat, the authors of the new study examined DNA taken from bones and teeth of ancient cat remains. They also studied samples from the skin and hair of mummified Egyptian cats (and you thought emptying the litter tray was bad enough).
They found that all modern cats have ancestors among the Near Eastern and Egyptian cats, although the contributions of these two groups to the gene pool of today’s cats probably happened at different times. From there, the DNA analysis suggests domestic cats spread out over a period of around 1,300 years to the 5th century AD, with remains recorded in Bulgaria, Turkey and Jordan.
‘Blotched’ tabby cat genes became more common alongside striped ‘mackerel’ patterns in the later Middle Ages.
Ottoni et al., 2017/Nature, Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford
,
Author provided
Over the next 800 years, domestic cats spread further into northern Europe. But it wasn’t until the 18th century that the traditional “mackerel” coat of the wildcat began to change in substantial numbers to the blotched pattern that we see in many modern tabbies. This suggests that, at that time, serious efforts to breed cats for appearance began – perhaps the origin of modern cat shows.
Another interesting finding is that domestic cats from earliest times, when moved around by humans to new parts of the world, promptly mated with local wildcats and spread their genes through the population. And, in the process, they permanently changed the gene pool of cats in the area.
This has particular relevance to today’s efforts to protect the endangered European wildcat, because conservationists often think
interbreeding with domestic cats
is one of the greatest threats to the species. If this has been happening all over the old world for the past 9,000 or so years, then perhaps it’s time to stop worrying about wildcats breeding with local moggies. This study suggests that none of the existing species of non-domesticated cats is likely to be pure. In fact, cats’ ability to interbreed has helped them conquer the world."
"Love for cats lures students into this course, which uses feline research to teach science",https://theconversation.com/love-for-cats-lures-students-into-this-course-which-uses-feline-research-to-teach-science-235838,"Uncommon Courses
is an occasional series from The Conversation U.S. highlighting unconventional approaches to teaching.
Title of course:
“The Science of Cats”
What prompted the idea for the course?
I’m an evolutionary biologist
who has spent my career studying the evolution of small lizards in the Caribbean. I’m also a lifelong cat lover, but it never occurred to me to do anything scientific with house cats. They’re hard to study – ever tried to follow your cat around to see what they’re doing? And in contrast to amply studied lions, tigers and other wild felines, I was under the impression that there wasn’t any interesting research being conducted on the domestic representative of the cat clan,
Felis catus
.
Twelve years ago, I learned that I was completely wrong. Thanks to John Bradshaw’s book “
Cat Sense
” and the BBC’s “
The Secret Life of the Cat
,” I discovered that
ailurologists
were using the same cutting-edge methods – GPS tracking, genome sequencing, isotopic analysis – to study domestic cats that I use to study lizards and other researchers use with all manner of other creatures.
Thus was born my class on the science of cats. I’d lure students in with their love of felines and then, when they weren’t looking, I’d teach them how scientists study biodiversity – ecology, evolution, genetics and behavior.
What does the course explore?
In essence, the course is about the past, present and future of cats: where they came from, why they do what they do, what the future may hold. And, critically, how we know what we know – that is, how scientists address these sorts of questions.
The course concludes with students writing an original paper or making a mini-documentary. These projects have spanned a vast range of topics in biology and beyond, such as the impact of cats on bird populations, sexism and the crazy cat lady trope, the health effects pro and con of living with felines, the role of hybridization as a creative or constraining force in evolution, the top-down role of larger predators like coyotes and dingoes in controlling cat numbers, and the prospects for new genetic technologies to create allergen-free cats or to curb free-roaming cat populations.
Unexpectedly, the students weren’t the only ones who ended up writing about cats: The class and its themes inspired me to write my own book, “
The Cat’s Meow: How Cats Evolved from the Savanna to Your Sofa
.”

Why is this course relevant now?
Society needs more biodiversity scientists to understand our rapidly changing world. Cats pose scientific questions of broad interest, and they may serve as a gateway introduction to the world of biological research.
What’s a critical lesson from the course?
Important research on the natural world does not require traveling to remote corners of the world. Research on common animals in local surroundings – even household pets – can make important advances in basic and applied knowledge.
What materials does the course feature?
In addition to reading research papers, we took field trips that were both eye-opening and fun. We went out at the crack of dawn to join a homeless-cat advocate feeding unowned felines in a rundown part of town. We also learned about cats in ancient times from an Egyptologist, traveled to a cat show to marvel at the diversity of cat breeds, observed wild felines at the Saint Louis Zoo and examined cats in art at university museums.
What will the course prepare students to do?
Cat research is the vehicle for students to see the applicability of scientific ideas to animals they know and care for greatly. The course not only requires students to synthesize knowledge from many different fields, but also gets them to think about real-world contemporary debates, such as what to do about outdoor cats and the ethics of breeding."
"Baiting foxes can make feral cats even more ‘brazen’, study of 1.5 million forest photos shows",https://theconversation.com/baiting-foxes-can-make-feral-cats-even-more-brazen-study-of-1-5-million-forest-photos-shows-223352,"Foxes and cats kill about
2.6 billion mammals, birds and reptiles
across Australia, every year. To save native species from extinction, we need to protect them from these introduced predators. But land managers tend to focus on foxes, which are easier to control. Unfortunately this may have unintended consequences.
We wanted to find out how feral cats respond to fox control. In one of the biggest studies on this issue to date, we worked with land managers to set up 3,667 survey cameras in a series of controlled experiments. We studied the effects on cat behaviour and population density.
Our research shows feral cats are

Could feral cats benefit from fox control?
Foxes and cats were brought to Australia by European colonisers more than 170 years ago. They now coexist across much of the mainland.
While foxes are bigger than cats, they
compete for many of the same prey species
.
But most wildlife conservation programs in southern Australia only control foxes. That’s largely because controlling foxes is relatively straightforward. Foxes are scavengers and readily take poison baits. Feral cats, on the other hand, prefer live prey. So they’re much more difficult to control using baits.
Consequently, foxes have become the
most widely controlled
invasive predator in Australia, while feral cat control has been relatively localised.
Some native species have thrived following fox control or eradication, but others have continued to decline. For example, one study found numbers of common brushtail possums, Western quolls and Tammar wallabies increased following fox control in southwest Western Australia. However,
seven other species crashed
: dunnarts, woylies, southern brown bandicoots, western ringtail possums, bush rats, brush-tailed phascogales and western brush wallabies.
People suspected controlling foxes could inadvertently free feral cats from competition and aggression, particularly if there were no dingoes around.
Foxes devastate native wildlife, but may also suppress feral cats.
Matthew Rees
Experimenting with fox control
To investigate how cats respond to fox control programs, we worked with land managers to run two large experiments in southwest Victoria. Foxes are the top predator in these forests and woodlands, because dingoes have already been removed.
We studied cat behaviour and population density before and after fox control in the Otway Ranges. In a separate study, we compared conservation reserves with and without fox control in the Glenelg region.
We put out 3,667 survey cameras over seven years. The cameras photograph animals as they walk by, allowing us to analyse where and when invasive predators and native mammals are active.
From these photographs, we were also able to identify individual feral cats based on their unique coat markings.
When multiple photographs of one cat were taken by several different cameras, we could track their movement. Combining information on the tracks of all the cats in an area allowed us to estimate cat population density.
It was a painstaking process. We went through almost 1.5 million images manually to check for animals, eliminate false triggers and identify individual cats.
Future research is exploring using
artificial intelligence to streamline the process
, but the computer still needs to be taught what to look for.
We identified 160 different feral cats across two fox control programs in south-west Victoria.
Matthew Rees
What we found
We found
sustained, intensive baiting for foxes
worked. Areas with more poison baits had fewer foxes. Replacing baits regularly was also worthwhile.
Feral cat density was generally
higher in areas with fox control
. The strength of this effect varied with the extent and duration of fox management. We found up to 3.7 times as many cats in fox-baited landscapes.
Productive landscapes also supported more cats. There was about
one feral cat per square kilometre in wet forests
, compared with
less than half as many in dry forests
.
Feral cat behaviour also varied with fox control and forest type,
including how visible cats were, how far they moved
, and
what times of day they were active
.
Feral cats appeared more adventurous where fox populations were suppressed. In dry forests, for example, foxes were largely nocturnal, as were most native mammals. Feral cats became more active at night when there were fewer foxes, potentially giving them access to different prey species.
We found some threatened species, such as
long-nosed potoroos, were doing much better
in areas with long-term fox control, although others, such as southern brown bandicoots, showed no improvement.
We don’t know how fox control affected smaller native rodents and marsupials, which are likely to be
most at risk from increased cat predation
.
Areas where foxes were controlled had more feral cats. They also tended to be behave differently.
Matthew Rees
A conservation balancing act
Broad-scale fox control is an important tool in the ongoing battle to protect Australia’s wildlife. Fox baiting is relatively simple and effective. But we have to balance the known benefits of fox control against potential unintended consequences.
Our study reinforces the need to carefully consider what could happen if you only control one pest animal, and to monitor carefully rather than assume that fox control will benefit all native species. We are not saying people should stop fox baiting, because there are clear benefits to species such as long-nosed potoroos. But we need to keep an eye on the cats and might need to also manage their impacts on native prey.
As feral cats are
notoriously difficult to control lethally
, indirect management may also be helpful. For example,
promoting dense understorey vegetation for native prey to hide in
or removing other sources of food that boost cat numbers such as
pest rabbits
.
Integrated pest management is challenging and expensive but likely needed, especially where feral cats or other pests are thriving alongside foxes.

Cats can get dementia too – here are the eight signs to look out for,https://theconversation.com/cats-can-get-dementia-too-here-are-the-eight-signs-to-look-out-for-263148,"Many cat owners don’t realise that just like humans, cats can suffer from dementia. A recent paper has even found many similarities between
feline and human dementia
, finding that cognitive impairment may
develop in similar ways
.
Some of the symptoms of dementia in cats are even similar to what we might see in humans – though not all of them, of course. Knowing what signs to look out for is important so you can provide your cat with the best care during this phase of its life.
Feline cognitive dysfunction syndrome (also known as feline dementia) is an age-related decline in a cat’s cognitive abilities. It’s generally characterised by behavioural changes that cannot be attributed to other medical conditions.
Feline dementia is thought to be very common in older cats. One study found that by 15 years of age, more than
half of cats
showed signs of dementia. However, some behaviour associated with the condition has also been identified in cats
as young as seven
. A separate survey of cat owners also found that
around 28% of cats
aged between 11 and 14 exhibited at least one behavioural change associated with dementia.
Behavioural changes
are often the first indication that there may be something wrong. There are eight signs to look out for that might indicate
your cat has dementia
.
1. Unusual vocalisation:
Your cat might start to vocalise excessively, or in new situations. A common example of this is
meowing loudly at night
.
2. Altered interactions:
Cats with dementia sometimes
seek attention more
often or become “clingy”. Equally, cats with dementia might interact less than previously, appear irritable or seem not to recognise familiar people.
3. Sleep changes:
You may notice changes in your cat’s
sleeping habits
– often becoming restless at night and sleeping more during the day.
4. House soiling:
Changes in toilet habits can be a sign of several different conditions, but
toileting outside the litter tray
can be a common sign of dementia in cats.
5. Disorientation:
Just like people with dementia, cats may show
signs of confusion
or wandering behaviour. This might appear as losing their bearings, staring blankly at walls, getting stuck behind objects or going to the wrong side of the door.
Cats with dementia may become more clingy than they were previously.

6. Changes in activity levels:
A cat with dementia may be
more or less active than usual
. They may play less often or be less inclined to explore. You might also notice them spending less time taking care of themselves, for example grooming or washing themselves less.
7. Appearing anxious:
A cat with dementia might show
signs of anxiety
in situations that they were previously confident with – such as around familiar people, places or sounds. An anxious cat might hide more often, going under the bed or on top of cupboards to escape.
8. Learning problems:
Cats with dementia may be less unable to perform
previously learned tasks
, such as finding their food bowl, and may have difficulty learning new tasks.
Caring for your cat
There’s significant overlap between symptoms of feline dementia and other common conditions, such as
arthritis
and
kidney disease
. So if you see any of these behavioural changes in your cat, you should speak to your vet to rule out these other conditions.
Research into feline dementia is limited. Much of what we know about prevention and treatment is extrapolated from research into humans and dogs. And, as with these other species, there’s no cure for dementia in cats. But there are ways of limiting the impact of the disease.
Certain environmental modifications can help stimulate cats,
activating their brains and causing nerves to grow
. But the severity of your cat’s dementia must be considered before making any of these changes.
In healthy or mildly affected cats, promoting play or simulating hunting with interactive toys and encouraging exploration using hide and seek games is thought to
delay the progression
of cognitive dysfunction.
But in cats with severe cognitive impairment, changing their environment could lead to confusion and anxiety –
worsening behavioural symptoms
.
Diet changes
– specifically the addition of supplements containing antioxidants (vitamin E and C) and essential fatty acids – may also help to reduce inflammation in the brain, slowing the disease’s progression.
However, only dog-specific supplements have been tested in scientific research and proven to enhance cognition in dogs. But if you do want to try giving these supplements to your cat, be sure you only give them supplements approved for felines. Dog supplements should not be given to cats as they may include substances that are toxic to cats – such as
alpha lipoic acid
.
Feline dementia is a condition both highly prevalent and challenging to manage. Knowing what symptoms to look out for can ensure your cat gets diagnosed earlier on. This will also ensure you’re able to make the necessary changes to its environment or diet that will ultimately improve its quality of life."
Why do cats knead?,https://theconversation.com/why-do-cats-knead-192743,"“Kneading” is when cats massage an object with the front paws, which extend and retract, one paw at a time.
This massaging action, named for its resemblance to kneading dough, is repeated rhythmically. You may have spotted your cat kneading and wondered how on Earth they developed such a behaviour.
So, why
do
cat’s knead? Does it tell us anything about how they’re feeling and is there anything you can do if they’re painfully kneading you while sitting on your lap?

Do hypoallergenic cats even exist? 3 myths dispelled about cat allergies
The evolutionary background of kneading
Cats first begin to knead when just tiny kittens, still nursing from their mother. Kneading is associated with suckling, which helps stimulate a mother cat’s
milk supply
through the
release of oxytocin
and likely evolved for this reason.
Kneading also has another evolutionary advantage. It can be used as a form of tactile and pheromone communication between kitten and mother.
Cats have scent glands in their soft paw pads, and when they knead, these glands release pheromones (chemical messages used to communicate).
Kneading on their mother releases
pheromones
associated with bonding, identification, health status or many other messages.
One of these, known as “cat appeasing pheromone”, is released by the sebaceous glands round the mammary glands.
Pheromones are not only important for bonding between the mother and young. Cat appeasing pheromone also has the potential to treat
aggression
in mature cats.
Kneading can be used as a form of tactile and pheromone communication between kitten and mother.
Shutterstock
If kneading is a kitten behaviour, why is my adult cat still doing it?
While kneading evolved to stimulate milk supply and express chemical and tactile messages between kitten and mother, it’s also a common behaviour in adult cats, because of something called
neoteny
.
Neoteny is when an animal retains their juvenile physical or behaviour traits into adulthood. It’s likely these traits are advantageous for cats when needing to socialise with humans and other cats or animals in the household.
Kneading, in particular, may be retained into adulthood because it can help communicate messages.
Kneading on your lap is a cat’s way of saying “we’re affiliated” or “you’re in my social group”. Or, to be very human about it, “you’re my person”.
We may also reinforce kneading by rewarding our cat with attention when they do it.
Some cats like to knead on soft or woollen blankets while also
sucking
on the material, as if from a teat. This may be relaxing or soothing for the cat because of this association.
We may also reinforce kneading by rewarding our cat with attention when they do it.
Shutterstock
What does kneading say about how our cats are feeling?
In most cases, kneading likely indicates your cat is comfortable.
However, if the kneading (and especially sucking) occur very frequently, for a long time, appear compulsive or are beginning to damage your cat’s paws, legs or mouth, it may be a sign your cat is stressed or in pain and needs to see a vet.
Kneading and sucking can become compulsive, a
particular problem in Siamese and Birman cats
.
Some cats don’t knead at all. Just like people, cats are individuals and like to show that they are comfortable or affiliated with you in their own ways.
Kneading likely indicates your cat is comfortable.
Giphy.
Help! My cat kneading is hurting my legs
Kneading is a normal behaviour that may be an important part of your cat feeling bonded with you. If your cat’s claws are getting a little too involved for your liking then invest in a thick blanket that you can cover your legs with. Avoid telling them off or kicking them off your lap.
Instead, reward kneading where the claws are kept to a minimum by showing more attention via patting or handing out a food treat when your cat is kneading the way you would like them to.
You can even add in a cue to request the claws go away. Something short like “pads!” would be a good option. Simply associate the word and a food reward with the behaviour you want.
And if you need your cat more than they knead you, that’s OK too.

"What is the story ofmaneki-neko, the Japanese beckoning cat?",https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-story-of-maneki-neko-the-japanese-beckoning-cat-203906,"Maneki-neko, translated as beckoning cat but also known as lucky cat or welcome cat, is recognisable internationally, often found behind cash registers of restaurants and retail outlets – and also in your phone.
But how did the cat come to be, and what does it mean in Japan?
Cats, great companions and pets, probably arrived in Japan as early as a
few thousand years ago
, and by the
eighth century
appeared in literature and mythology.
As in the rest of the world, cats were useful in catching rats and mice.
Cats were precious and often kept on a leash, as in this 1768–70 painting by Suzuki Harunobu.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art
The population of domesticated cats, however, was relatively small. Because they were precious, some cats were kept on leashes to keep them close, rather than letting them run wild.
During the Edo period (1603-1868), paintings of cats were sold to silkworm farmers. These images were believed powerful enough to scare off silkworm predators: rats and mice.
Paintings of cats were believed to keep mice away. This one was by Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797–1861).

Ancient DNA reveals how cats conquered the world
A symbol of good fortune
Maneki-neko style Japanese cat dolls can be traced back to the Edo period (1603-1868), or shortly beforehand. They probably first appeared in the Buddhist temples
Gotokuji
,
Saihoji
, or
Jishoin
, all located in Edo, today’s Tokyo.
Because the dolls have roots in the new eastern capital – instead of the traditional Japanese centre of Kyoto and its surrounding area of western Japan – we know maneki-neko is relatively new in Japanese history.

Each Edo temple has a different story about how maneki-neko came to be.
At the Gotokuji temple, the legend is based on the story of Ii Naotaka (1590-1659), the lord samurai of the Hikone domain. While passing Gotokuji, Naotka was beckoned by a cat at the temple gate. As he came inside he was saved from an unexpected heavy thunderstorm.
Out of gratitude, the samurai decided to provide continuous donations to the temple that had been struggling financially. The cat became the temple’s symbol and brought them continuous good fortune. Today, the temple attracts tourists from all over Japan and the world.

Economic prosperity
When and where the ceramic cats began to be sold remains a mystery, but by the late Edo period they found appeal with urban consumers.
Clear evidence of this is found in Utagawa Hiroshige’s
ukiyo-e
print from 1852,
which depicts
a stall selling numerous doll cats. But these cats look slightly different from many cats we see in the 21st century; they hold no koban gold coins.
These cats, as seen in today’s Gotokuji cats, wore a bell around their necks, and were said to bring good luck to the owner.
This book illustration from 1852 shows a shop selling maneki-neko.
NDL Digital Collections
In the Meiji era (1868-1912)
mass production
by using plaster moulds made the cat a popular figure nationwide. The cat came to represent material rather than emotional happiness.
By then, bells around cats’ necks were typically replaced with coins – perhaps linked to Japan’s increasing economic prosperity.
On this 20th century terracotta cat, the bell around its neck has been replaced with a coin.

The earlier ceramic cats looked like cats rather than cartoon characters.
In the 1950s, makers in Aichi Prefecture adapted the form of its local dolls,
Okkawa Ningyo
, onto the dolls of cats. The head became as big as the body and eyes became widely opened.
Later in the century, maneki-neko gained popularity in the Chinese-speaking world through Hong Kong and Taiwan. Altars in Hong Kong tea houses had traditionally been dedicated to legends such as the 3rd century Chinese military general
Guan Yu
, but these days the pretty cats are
also featured
.
The cats then spread globally through a diffusion of Asian culture by Asian migrants.
Today, turn on your phone and launch the Pokemon app. You might soon capture Meowth, a maneki-neko pokemon with a koban (gold coin) on its forehead.
‘Cool Japan’
While in the English-speaking world, it is commonly held that “money doesn’t buy happiness,” it is permissible under Japan’s spiritual code to pray for personal material desires.

The Japanese equivalent of the phrase “cast pearls before swine” is “
cast coins before cats

And so maneki-neko, the pretty cat, welcomes you – and your money.
This feline welcome nicely reflects Japan’s soft power policy known as “

Why the pandemic made some cats sick with stress – and how we can help them,https://theconversation.com/why-the-pandemic-made-some-cats-sick-with-stress-and-how-we-can-help-them-167666,"Those of us who own pets probably enjoyed their company in the depths of the pandemic. Not only are pets potentially good for our
physical health
, they also benefit our
mental wellbeing
. Indeed, they may have even been a way of coping with
pandemic-fuelled
mental health problems.
But this is still an emerging area of research, so the impacts of pet ownership on human health aren’t always
clear cut
. Recent research suggests that having to care for a pet during the pandemic could actually have compromised our
quality of life
– including how satisfied we are with our health, lifestyle and relationships.
In the same way, how we interact with our pets and how we choose to manage them might inadvertently be causing them stress, too. While some family pets may have enjoyed their owners spending a lot more time with them than usual, there have been reports that some cats were less enamoured with these changes to their routine – even reportedly
becoming sick
from the stress of their owners being home all the time. So how do these dynamics work and is there anything we pet owners can do to minimise them?
Affectionate but independent
Those of us less enamoured with domestic cats might see them as a bit aloof, or cold and calculating. We might assume that cats are less interested in us or aware of our feelings
compared to dogs
, for example.
But cats are actually capable of being highly sociable with humans and are probably picking up on a lot more than many people give them credit for. For example, cats are able to
recognise their own names
and are sensitive to the
emotional expressions
of their owners. Cats may also be negatively impacted by our
personalities
, with anxious and depressed owners linked to greater stress in their cats.
Cats have potentially also mastered the subtle art of human manipulation within
their purrs
by embedding a “cry” sound within them. Scientists think they use this sound to tap into our care-giving instincts, just like human infants do. Indeed, cats are capable of producing a broad range of
different vocalisations
to express themselves – though we might not necessarily
understand them
.
Yet while cats can certainly develop
positive relationships with humans
, they’re not born with an innate desire for human company and must be
sufficiently handled
when young. As adults, some cats are much more sociable than others – though even friendly cats prefer people that allow them to dictate the nature of their interactions. Not stroking them too much can even increase their
levels of affection
and reduce aggression.
Cats prefer to dictate the nature of their interactions.

This is very different from humans, who
use touch
(like hugs) to strengthen our social relationships. Humans also tend to seek support from others when stressed or unwell, while cats
prefer to hide
and be alone.
Cats also experience greater stress when exposed to
unpredictable routines and handling
. In general, cats value their autonomy and to be able to avoid the things they find unpleasant.
Stopping stress
The rise in some cats’ stress levels during the pandemic is likely due to the disruptions to their daily peace that we’ve unwittingly caused. By being at home more, we have probably created a much busier, more chaotic environment than they are used to – and may be causing them more stress when we want to lavish them with attention.
Given that cats can
recognise humans emotions
, our elevated stress levels and desire to spend more time interacting with them has likely made matters worse. Some people may have also made other changes during the pandemic – such as redecorating, having a baby or even getting another pet.
There are many things we can do to help cats better cope and be less stressed:
Provide cats with a predictable routine.
This means keeping mealtimes, play and interactions with them to a schedule where possible.
Give them a dedicated quiet room or area.
And when they’re in these areas, ensure they’re never disturbed. You should also let your cat choose when they want to
interact with you
.
Create
an enriching
indoor and outdoor environment.
To help your cat feel safe, provide them with lots of hiding options and places they can get up high. Place litter trays in separate areas from food and water bowls and locate all these resources in quieter areas of the home. Provide toys, climbing frames, food puzzles and cat-friendly plants (such as
cat nip
) to help keep your cat physically and mentally stimulated.
Give your cat plenty of time and space to themselves.
If your cat is sleeping, resting or otherwise seems happy doing their own thing, don’t be tempted to disturb them or solicit their attention
Keeping your cat physically fit and ensuring they are in good health will help to rule out any underlying medical issues. If you think your cat could be suffering from stress then seeking professional advice from a vet and subsequently a qualified cat behaviour specialist is also recommended.
With many of us starting to return to normal, our cats will be faced with further changes to their environment. But cats are most likely to cope well as you leave the house more – so long as new routines are predictable and they have plenty to keep them occupied while you’re gone. In truth, many cats will likely appreciate the extra peace and quiet."
NZ is taking aim at feral cats. Are we ready for the ethical and practical implications?,https://theconversation.com/nz-is-taking-aim-at-feral-cats-are-we-ready-for-the-ethical-and-practical-implications-270885,"Conservationists have long anticipated the
recent announcement
that the national effort to eradicate possums, stoats and rats will now include feral cats.
But the government’s decision steers New Zealand’s
Predator Free 2050 mission
into potentially fractious territory.
It suggests conservation messaging has effectively recast wild-living cats as predators. In doing so, they become the kind of problem that can be solved through the conventional logic of pest control.
The new policy rests on a crucial distinction between
feral cats
and others, and hinges on their degree of human attachment. A feral cat has no human relationships, while domestic and stray cats have greater involvement in human worlds.
Legally, feral cats are already classified as pests and
research suggests
this designation is broadly accepted. But as one pest control operator recently told me, even a pet cat in a cage looks and acts feral if it is trapped and afraid.
Conversely, stray and feral cats are often re-homed and made into loving companions. Indeed, cats show remarkable behavioural flexibility – a reminder that deterministic assumptions about species can be risky.
Making feral cats a target species also reflects culture change in real time. There is nothing “natural” about which animals we choose to kill and which we choose to protect.
Although some species’ deaths are widely normalised – think of the few animals we kill in their millions for food – that sense of normality is shaped by deliberate efforts to frame certain animals in particular ways.
As
several commentators
have noted, the idea of eradicating cats caused public dismay only a decade ago. Today, it is not only thinkable, but doable.
How cats became Predator Free’s next target
The culture shift is likely due to several things, possibly including a growing confidence in the Predator Free mission, careful coalition building by the
National Cat Management Group
, and a wave of research into cats’ ecological impacts.
We have also heard sustained and strategic messaging from Predator Free that
describes cats
as “among the most devastating predators in Aotearoa”.
But feline flexibility – cats’ ability to be both a smoochy pet and a stealthy killer, potentially both over the course of a lifetime or even a day – might also be cause for caution.
At a recent Predator Free hui, for instance, one volunteer asked for tips on what to do with a trapped cat. The cautionary response was that the cat might be shot or possibly bludgeoned. (The
Animal Welfare Act
prohibits drowning because of its cruelty.)
This is quite different from the trapping methods mainly used now, and from the kinds of lethal actions volunteer trappers normally carry out.
Current guidelines say kill traps should only be used in very remote areas; everywhere else, live-capture cage traps are the only option. The result, as you’d expect, is a live, enclosed cat.
Kill traps that meet
National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee
standards are a kind of “moral delegate”. They remove some of the ethical complexity from the act of killing and make the job more straightforward.
Killing live-trapped cats could instead invite a degree of moral reflection –perhaps even prompt a wider conversation about animal welfare.
Predator Free 2050’s
2020 strategy
made no mention of animal welfare, beyond citing the Animal Welfare Act. And its latest
research strategy
is similarly focused elsewhere.
But the addition of feral cats to the official predator list is an opportunity to engage with these difficult questions. Should anyone be able to kill a trapped cat? What standards and protocols might be necessary?
The cultural catch with cats
It’s easy to see why welfare has not been front and centre of pest control conversations to date.
Until now, the Predator Free 2050 target species have been firm cultural outcasts, regarded as an ecological problem and laden with unfavourable symbolic associations. Cats, even feral ones, are a different beast.
Rather than being associated with viciousness, dirtiness and overpopulation like many other pests, cats are more commonly associated with companionship and cuteness.
Even their hunting skills have historically been a source of value and appreciation, as testified by the use of cats as “ratters” in workplaces, homes and ships.
Although only feral cats fall under the Predator Free remit, their domestic counterparts are already part of the conversation as well.
For example, the multi-stakeholder National Cat Management Group is proposing a
National Cat Management Act
as part of a broader, welfare-oriented cat strategy that encompasses feral, stray and companion animals.
This too raises questions about what kinds of social creatures we think cats are, or want them to be. Should they become family members who stay in the home? Or do people want cities and neighbourhoods where they encounter cats as well as birds in public spaces?
And what about us? What kind of “cat people” are we?"
Is your dog or cat getting old? These simple gestures could help them live longer and happier lives,https://theconversation.com/is-your-dog-or-cat-getting-old-these-simple-gestures-could-help-them-live-longer-and-happier-lives-270735,"Geriatric veterinary care is in great shape, with dogs and cats living on average 11.3 years, according to French data. Our knowledge of how to accompany them in later life is expanding fast. We now know that simple changes can do wonders for an old cat or dog’s comfort and quality of life. The main trick is for pet owners not to stand by idly as their four-legged companions’ age.
At what age can my dog or cat be considered old?
A study of over two million cats and four million dogs has enabled us to better define their different life stages.
Cats enter old age at around 10 years old. This period is then divided into mature, senior and super-senior stages.
The same study points out that it’s less uniform for dogs, for whom old age depends heavily upon size.
Small dogs (
toy
and
small
breeds weighing less than 9 kg, such as Chihuahuas or Cavalier King Charles Spaniels) enter their third age at around 7 years old, then become seniors at around 12 years old.
Medium to large dogs weighing more than 9 kg, such as Welsh Corgis, Golden Retrievers and Australian Shepherds, for example, reach this stage earlier: around 6.
Even as a super-senior, this Golden Retriever can maintain a good quality of life.

Not to panic, however: the new stage needn’t mean that the end is near. Rather, it may just be time to pay greater attention to your pet and to gradually adjust their environment, medical and care routine to help them age in the best possible conditions.
What is healthy ageing? How can you assess it in your pet?
But before we even talk about “healthy ageing”, it’s useful to recall what ageing is: a natural, gradual and inevitable process. Over time, animals become less tolerant of environmental stress and their cells accumulate damage, leading to various physiological changes.
So, what do we mean by a dog or cat ageing “in good health”? A recent
consensus article
in which I participated offers a definition adapted to our pets: an elderly animal in good health is one that retains sufficient capacity and resilience to meet its physical, behavioural, social and emotional needs, while maintaining a stable and positive relationship with its human.
Some signs are completely normal: greying hair, slight tartar build-up, thinner skin, and slightly duller senses–these bear no noticeable impact on quality of life.
Some physical changes are perfectly normal.

On the other hand, mobility issues that hinder access to resources (difficulty getting up, climbing stairs or interacting easily with you) should not be considered simply as signs of ageing. The same goes with the first signs of
cognitive dysfunction
(a syndrome that has some similarities with Alzheimer’s disease) when a dog or cat struggles to find its food bowl or seems lost in the house, for example. These cases call for veterinary advice.
Quality of life therefore becomes the central criterion for assessing whether an animal is ageing harmoniously. In dogs and cats, the concept of frailty, derived from human geriatrics, is now used (see table below).
How can you assess your pet’s frailty?**
Animals classified as frail are more prone to
developing diseases
and should be monitored
more closely
.
The major advantage of this approach is that, as in humans, frailty detected early
can sometimes be mitigated
. Hence the importance of regular screening and early support to best care for our elderly companions.
Some adjustments to be made
The first step is to make the animal’s environment more accessible so that it can easily reach all its resources: food, water, resting and hiding spots, contact areas, etc. A few props and adjustments can make a real difference, including small steps to climb onto the sofa, armchairs, firm and low cushions, or raised bowls for dogs and cats suffering from osteoarthritis, etc.
High cushions or armchairs allow old pusses to tower over their domain.

Increasing the number of access points is also useful: two or three feeding areas, several places to sleep, and more litter trays that are easy to step over. Some commercial litter trays are too high for cats with osteoarthritis; a wide tray with a low rim can be much more comfortable.
Maintaining a calm and positive relationship is
essential
. Behaviour that is considered “undesirable” should always be investigated by a vet and a behaviourist (or a veterinary behaviourist): it may reflect a need,
discomfort or difficulty
. A cat that scratches the carpet rather than its scratching post, for example, may simply be looking for a less painful position. Some animals also become
more anxious or reactive
with age or certain medical conditions; it is therefore important to understand the cause rather than punish them, at the risk of damaging the relationship and failing to resolve the issue.
Cognitive and physical stimulation
must continue
, but adapted to the animal’s abilities. “Puzzle feeders” (or interactive bowls, where animals have to solve puzzles to get their food) are still useful, provided they are chosen according to the animal’s condition: a scratch mat or an interactive bowl that can be pushed by the nose are preferable to a system that requires complex leg movements. Games, learning and small training sessions are still beneficial; sometimes it is enough to shorten the sessions and use very enticing rewards (think small pieces of chicken breast or sausage, etc.).
Carriers are a great way for older pets to get fresh air.

Walks can be adapted, in particular by using comfortable and safe bags to carry the dog when it is too tired, either for part or all of the walk. The important thing is to continue to give the animal access to the outdoors.
Finally,
diet
is key when caring for older animals. Ageing leads to changes in digestion and a gradual loss of muscle mass. It is therefore recommended to
choose a diet
that is easily digestible, has a smell and taste that appeal to your pet, and is specifically formulated for the needs of senior animals. Raw meat should be avoided: it’s often unbalanced in terms of minerals, which can be harmful to older animals, who are particularly
sensitive to excess phosphorus
or inappropriate calcium/phosphorus ratios. They also present an
increased health risk,
as their immune systems are
less effective
.
On the other hand, combining dry food (kibble) and wet food (terrine, mousses, etc.) is often beneficial. A cooked, homemade meal (following the advice of a vet) can also help an animal regain its appetite. And for the fussiest eaters, a simple trick may suffice:
warm the wet food
slightly to enhance its smell and make it more appealing.
When should you see your vet?
Regular vet check-ups are still essential, particularly to keep up to date with vaccinations and worming. Ageing
weakens the immune system
, making senior animals more vulnerable and requiring regular protection against infectious diseases and parasites.
Geriatric consultations aim to monitor the ageing process, which is unique to each individual. The first consultation is often the longest to allow for an in-depth discussion and include additional tests where necessary. These initial findings will serve as a reference for follow-up visits. Ideally, this monitoring should begin at the start of the third age. The frequency of consultations then depends on the animal’s trajectory: every six months if signs of frailty appear, or once a year if its condition remains stable.
The challenge is no longer just to extend the lifespan of our furry friends, but to, above all, prolong their health. After all, we want them to enjoy it as long as possible, much as we would for humans."
Exotic animal cafes: cute trend or welfare crisis?,https://theconversation.com/exotic-animal-cafes-cute-trend-or-welfare-crisis-271147,"Imagine sipping a latte while stroking an owl or watching an otter play at your feet. This is the promise of exotic animal cafes, a trend that blends coffee culture with wildlife encounters. But behind the Instagram-worthy photos lies a troubling reality – the welfare of the animals themselves.
Since the mid-2000s, animal cafes have increased in popularity with customers paying low-cost entrance fees, ranging from £8 to around £15, depending on the location and animals housed there. The concept seemed to have started with cat cafes
but now include
owls, meerkats, capybara, snakes and even penguins.
Taiwan, China and Japan seem to be leading the trend. But they are starting to pop up in the UK too, with
plans for a capybara cafe
in Norfolk announced in 2025. And there are already
capybara cafes
in Florida, US, that offer a “curated, slow-living experience that lets you connect with animals in a meaningful and memorable way”.
The appeal is obvious: exotic animals
are fascinating
. However animal rights activists have concerns about the cost to the animals. My colleagues and I recently
published research
on animal cafes in Japan which reveals they are failing animals on almost every welfare measure.
Owls at an owl cafe in Tokyo, Japan.
HowdenA/Alamy
We visited 79 exotic animal cafes across Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and other regions, observing 231 mammal, bird and reptile species. We scored conditions in five areas: environment, nutrition, behaviour, restraint and visitor interactions.
Our findings showed welfare standards were consistently poor across all species.
Birds suffered most. Owls, by far the most common species, were often tethered to
perches, unable to fly. Owls are nocturnal species and therefore their natural behaviour is to hide away during daylight hours. Many were exposed to loud music and constant human contact, conditions known to cause stress to birds.
Otters didn’t have water for swimming during opening hours. Meerkats, highly social animals, were kept alone in tiny cages. Even domestic species such as rabbits scored poorly for the number of human-animal interactions and the environment that was provided for them.
Reptiles fared slightly better, probably because their spatial needs are smaller. 
But many were housed in enclosures with no place for them to escape the public gaze or people tapping on their glass enclosures and had minimal enrichment.
Rabbits however did score higher on the nutrition scores. We linked this to the fact that they are domesticated, which means appropriate food is easy to purchase.
Do meerkats really belong in cafes?

Poor welfare isn’t just an ethical issue, it’s a public health concern. Close contact with stressed wild animals increases the risk of bites, scratches and disease transmission, from salmonella to
cryptosporidiosis
, a parasitic infection that causes profuse watery diarrhoea, stomach pains, nausea or vomiting and low-grade fever for up to two weeks.
In cramped cafes, these risks multiply. A recent study and
report compiled by WWF Japan
found dangerous bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, salmonella, and drug-resistant bacteria in some facilities.
Another issue is where these animals are coming from. Many of the species housed in exotic cafes are of
conservation importance
. It might be that they are being bought and sold in violation of international animal trade laws that prohibit the movement or sale of certain animals from their original native homeland.
The bigger picture
As mentioned above, Japan isn’t an outlier, with similar opportunities in China and Taiwan. The UK
has more than 40 cat cafes
plus the proposed
capybara cafe in Norfolk
. The number of cat cafes in the UK is increasing, with a 44% surge in licences granted over the past financial year.
A report from the
RSPCA and Cats Protection
, two of the largest animal welfare charities in the UK, is calling for a phase-out of cat cafes. They believe that cats, “having descended from solitary, territorial, roaming wildcats” are “likely to find the enforced proximity to other felines as well as unfamiliar visitors wishing to stroke them extremely stressful.”
It’s unclear whether these types of cafe can ever meet the complex physical and psychological needs of any species that they house any species that they house, whether they are wild or domesticated animals. Our research suggests the answer is no. These environments cannot provide space, stimulation or choice – the foundations of good animal welfare.
Cat cafes are becoming increasingly popular.

Animal welfare legislation around the world is complex. In a lot of countries, exotic cafes would fall under the same license as zoos. This is the case in Japan.
Japan’s animal welfare law
offers little specific protection for exotic species. It acknowledges animal sentience but provides little consideration to the care of captive wild animals.
In England, Scotland and Wales there are two forms of legislation that might be relevant to animal cafes. For a domestic cat cafe,
The Animal Welfare
(Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018 applies.
This includes the need for the cafe staff and owners to provide a suitable environment and diet and protect the animals from pain, suffering, injury and disease. It would also require cat cafes to monitor the animals’ behaviour, handling of the cats and interactions with customers. Inspections of these facilities do occur but are dependant on the local authorities who may or may not have animal welfare knowledge.
If cafes are to house non-domestic species, such as capybara, they would also need to have a dispensation zoo license under the
Zoo Licensing Act 1981
. This will mean that in the case of the proposed capybara cafe, they will need to be inspected in a similar way to a standard GB zoo but without having to contribute to conservation or education.
No matter where you are in the world or which animals they showcase, society must ask whether such cafes align with modern ethical values.
The simplest and most effective action you can take to oppose them is not to support these businesses. Every visit fuels demand for keeping wild animals in unsuitable environments.
When away from the UK, visit accredited zoos, wildlife sanctuaries, or conservation centres where animal welfare, conservation and education are prioritised. If you encounter cafés with poor conditions you should report them to local authorities or animal welfare charities such as
Wild Welfare
.
As these cafes gain popularity on social media, the conversation must shift from cuteness to responsibility."
Research reveals why pet owners keep their cats indoors – and it’s not to protect wildlife,https://theconversation.com/research-reveals-why-pet-owners-keep-their-cats-indoors-and-its-not-to-protect-wildlife-166263,"Cat owners are urged to keep their pet indoors for a variety of reasons, including protecting wildlife and preventing the spread of disease. But
our research
has found an entirely different motivator for containing cats.
Concern for their cat’s safety is the primary reason people keep cats inside. And people who allow cats to roam are also motivated by concern for the animal’s well-being.
Keeping domestic cats properly contained is crucial to protecting wildlife. Cats are natural predators – even if they’re well fed. Research
last year
found each roaming pet cat kills 186 reptiles, birds and mammals per year.
If we want more domestic cats kept indoors, it’s important to understand what motivates cat owners. Our research suggests messages about protecting wildlife are, on their own, unlikely to change cat owners’ behaviour.
Cats are natural predators, and can kill many animals each year if left to roam.

Why keep your cat indoors?
Cat containment involves confining the animals to their owners’ premises at all times.
In the Australian Capital Territory,
cat containment is mandatory
in several areas. From July next year, all new cats must be contained across the territory, unless on a leash.
In Victoria, about half of local councils have some form of cat containment legislation. Current revisions to
Domestic Animal Management Plans
could mean the practice becomes more widespread.

Cats have long been part of human societies and play an important social role in their owners’ lives. But our affection for the animals means efforts to keep cats contained can be met with opposition.
Officials, conservation groups and others put forward a range of reasons for containing cats, including:
preventing cats from spreading diseases and parasites such as toxoplasmosis to both
people
and
wildlife
reducing threats to wildlife, especially at night
reducing unwanted cat pregnancies
avoiding disputes with neighbours, including noise complaints, and cats defecating or spraying in garden beds and children’s sandpits
protecting cats from injury or death - such as being hit by a vehicle, attacked by dogs, snake bite and exposure to diseases and parasites.
So which argument is most persuasive? Our research suggests it’s the latter.
The Safe Cats Safe Wildlife campaign focuses on keeping cats safe.
Zoos Victoria.
What we found
We surveyed 1,024 people in Victoria – 220 of whom were cat owners.
We found 53% of cat owners did not allow roaming. These people were more likely to hold concerns about risks to cats’ safety than cat owners who allowed roaming. They were also less likely to believe cats have a right to roam.
Some 17% of cat owners allowed their cats unrestricted access to the outdoors day and night, while 30% contained their cats at night but allowed some unrestricted outdoor access during the day.
Both cat owners and other respondents generally believed cat owners should manage their pet’s roaming behaviour. But for cat owners, concern about harm to wildlife was not a significant predictor of containment behaviour.
Instead, people who keep their cats contained were more likely to be worried that their cat might be lost, stolen, injured or killed.
It’s not that cat owners don’t care about native animals - only about one in ten cat owners said they’d never seriously considered how their cat affects wildlife. But our survey results show this isn’t a big motivation for keeping cats indoors.
What Victorian cat owners are doing, based on our survey findings.

Roaming is dangerous
A roaming lifestyle can be risky to cats.
A 2019 study
of more than 5,300 Australian cat owners found 66% had lost a cat to a roaming incident such as a car accident or dog attack, or the cat simply going missing.
Despite the risks, people who let their cats roam are more likely to think the practice is better for the animal’s well-being – for example, that hunting is normal cat behaviour.
Owners who let their cat roam were more likely than those who contained their cat to believe their cat did not often hunt. While not all cats kill wildlife, those that do typically only bring home a small proportion of their catch. That means owners can be unaware of their cats’ impact.

Street life ain't easy for a stray cat, with most dying before they turn 1. So what's the best way to deal with them?
Cat owners must be made aware of the risks of roaming and equipped with the tools to keep their cats happy and safe
at home
. Unfortunately,
research shows
many Australian cat owners are not providing the safe environment and stimulation their cat needs when contained.
Cat containment doesn’t have to mean keeping the animal permanently in the house – nor does it require building them a
Taj Mahal
on the patio.
Cats can be outside while supervised or walked on leash. You can also
cat-proof
your backyard fence to keep them in.
Resources such as
Safe Cat Safe Wildlife
help owners meet their cat’s mental, physical and social needs while keeping them contained.
Moonee Valley City Council partners with the
Safe Cats Safe Wildlife
campaign to promote responsible cat ownership.
Changing containment behaviour
Our study shows cat containment campaigns can be more effective if messaging appeals to owners’ concern for their cats’ well-being. These messages could be delivered by trusted people
such as vets
.
Helping owners understand that cats’ needs can be met in containment, and giving them the tools to achieve this, may be the best way to protect wildlife.
Demonising cats
is not the answer. The focus must shift to the benefits of containment for cats’ well-being if we hope to achieve a cat-safe and wildlife-safe future.

How can I keep my cat happy? 5 tips from a vet to help your feline friend live their best life,https://theconversation.com/how-can-i-keep-my-cat-happy-5-tips-from-a-vet-to-help-your-feline-friend-live-their-best-life-242774,"Around
one third of Australian households live with at least one cat
, yet surveys tell us the cats’
needs are not being met
.
Cats may
rule the internet
, but humans often misconstrue feline behaviour. Earlier this year, the Washington Post boldly declared
cat’s arent jerks – they’re just misunderstood
. This was prompted by research showing that, contrary to unhelpful stereotypes,
cats are not antisocial
. They can and do bond closely with humans.
The more we learn about cats, the more we realise they are complex individuals with unique
personalities
and preferences, capable of
learning
.
From understanding your cat’s language to keeping them safe and healthy – here are science-backed tips to improve the lives of your feline flatmates.
Anyone who truly understands cats will readily tell you they can and do closely bond with their people.

1. Pay attention to body language
Cats communicate with humans using body language and vocalisation. However, while cats direct meows at humans, and the meows vary depending on the context, humans
are not great at decoding them
. But we can read cat body language.
For example, slow blinking is likely to indicate a
positive emotional state
. Cats who are not happy (for example, don’t want to be touched) will freeze, move away, flatten their ears, hiss, or – if they feel they have no other option – scratch or bite.
It is better to allow cats to approach you on their terms, rather than pushing for social interaction. A cat approaching you with their tail up is giving a
friendly signal
, while a tail swishing from side to side signals annoyance.
Cats should always have the option to opt out of any interaction, like being touched. If you aren’t sure, just “
ask
”: stop patting them. If they walk away, they’re not keen. If they rub their head against you, they want to continue the interaction.
Cat body language goes a long way to show whether they are enjoying the interaction or not.

2. Provide a healthy environment
The American Association of Feline Practitioners and the International Society of Feline Medicine have agreed upon
five pillars of a healthy feline environment
:
A safe space so that cats can retreat if frightened.
Multiple, separated key resources (food, water, toileting areas, scratching areas, play areas and resting or sleeping areas) so that cats can comfortably conduct their daily activities.
Opportunity for play and predatory behaviour, such as games with wand toys that simulate hunting.
Positive, consistent and predictable human-cat interactions, respecting a cat’s choice about whether and how they interact.
Respecting the importance of a cat’s senses by avoiding undesirable stimuli (strong smells and loud noises), and providing desirable sensory stimulation (for example, use of
catnip or silver vine
).
These pillars provide a useful checklist. If you read this and realise your cat’s food and water are right next to the litter tray, you can improve your cat’s environment (and their experiences of eating and toileting) by separating these resources right now.

3. Clean the litter tray!
A litter tray may represent an unpleasant chore to you, but the importance of a spacious litter tray to your cat cannot be overstated. Cats
prefer using a clean litter tray
, even if they are the only cat in the household.
Cats like to
spend time in the tray
before, during and after toileting, and they generally
prefer a large tray
.
Poor litter hygiene is associated with a risk of urinary problems, which can be
life-threatening
. 
A
survey of over 12,000 Australian cat owners
found that urinary problems were more common in households with a low number of litter trays per cat, less frequent removal of faeces from the trays, and the use of crystal-type cat litter.
If you switch the type of litter you provide, a
slow transition
is recommended to allow cats to get used to the change.
Maintaining a large, clean litter tray is vital for your indoor cat’s wellbeing and physical health.

4. Read the room
Do you have more than one cat? Tension between household cats is common but often overlooked, as it’s not always physical fighting. Signs of inter-cat tension can include prolonged staring, or even blocking the use of resources such as the litter tray or cat door, to prevent other cats from using them.
In their
2024 intercat-tension guidelines
, the American Association of Feline Practitioners note this can case chronic fear, anxiety and stress-related illnesses in cats.
Learning to recognise and manage tension between household cats can improve the welfare of all parties.
When you love your cat, it is tempting to seek to amplify the joy by adopting another. But many cats prefer to be the only cat in the household, and don’t cope well with a
feline flatmate
. If they have positive interactions with familiar, trusted humans, they’re unlikely to be lonely.
Many cats, like Audrey (pictured) actually prefer to be the solo cat in the household.
The Conversation
5. Keep cats and other animals safe
Historically, domesticated cats earned their keep
protecting grain stores
from rodents. But what constitutes responsible cat ownership has changed. Around 65% of Australia’s cat owners
confine their cats
indoors always, while 24% keep their cats confined at night.
A major driver for indoor-only housing of cats is their
predation of wildlife
. Another is concerns about roaming-associated risks to cats, including cat fights, infectious diseases (such as
feline immunodeficiency virus or FIV
), misadventure and motor vehicle trauma. But owners of cats kept entirely indoors were more likely to report
“problem” behaviours
.
Ideally, cats shouldn’t be allowed to free-roam unsupervised where they can harm wildlife, even within the bounds of the property where you live. More than a third of local councils in Australia
now require
cats to be contained overnight or 24 hours a day.
Outdoor access provides sensory stimulation, with different sights, sounds and smells. Alternatives to free roaming include providing access to a well-designed cat run, harness-training your cat, or supervising your cat.
Cats trained to walk on a leash with a harness can safely enjoy some supervised outdoor time.

Cats who don’t leave home unless they’re moving house or being taken to the vet, quickly learn to associate the cat carrier with a trip to an unfamiliar environment. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that a vet visit is imminent when the carrier comes out.
But that negative association can be changed.
Cats who were rewarded with treats
when they approached, stepped inside or rested in the carrier for six weeks were much less stressed during veterinary visits.
Cats are intelligent, and contrary to popular opinion, can be trained. The process can be enriching for cats and humans alike. With patience and commitment,
you can train your cat
– from a simple “sit” to voluntarily stepping into the cat carrier.
In short, give cats choice, respect their “cat-ness”, pay attention to their needs and try to see our world from their point of view. Your cat will be happier for it.
Contrary to popular opinion, cats can be trained.

If you own a cat and want to protect wildlife, you should keep it inside. In Australia, 1.1 million pet cats are contained 24 hours a day by responsible pet owners. The remaining 2.7 million pet cats – 71% of all pet cats – are able to roam and hunt.
What’s more, your pet cat could be getting out without you knowing.
A radio tracking study in Adelaide
found that of the 177 cats whom owners believed were inside at night, 69 cats (39%) were sneaking out for nocturnal adventures.

Just over one-quarter of Australian households (27%) have pet cats, and about half of cat-owning households have two or more cats.
Many owners believe their animals don’t hunt because they never come across evidence of killed animals.

Collectively, roaming pet cats kill 390 million animals per year in Australia.
This huge number may lead some pet owners to think the contribution of their own cat wouldn’t make much difference. However, we found even single pet cats have driven declines and complete losses of populations of some native animal species in their area.
Documented cases have included: a feather-tailed glider population in south eastern NSW; a
skink population in a Perth suburb
; and an
olive legless lizard population in Canberra
.
Urban cats
On average, an
individual feral cat
in the bush kills 748 reptiles, birds and mammals a year – four times the toll of a hunting pet cat. But feral cats and pet cats roam over very different areas.
Pet cats are confined to cities and towns, where you’ll find 40 to 70 roaming cats per square kilometre. In the bush there’s only one feral cat for every three to four square kilometres.
So while each pet cat kills fewer animals than a feral cat, their high urban density means the toll is still very high. Per square kilometre per year, pet cats kill 30-50 times more animals than feral cats in the bush.
The impact of roaming pet cats on Australian wildlife.
Most of us want to see native wildlife around towns and cities. But such a vision is being compromised by this extraordinary level of predation, especially as the human population grows and our cities expand.
Many native animals don’t have high reproductive rates so they cannot survive this level of predation. The stakes are especially high for threatened wildlife in urban areas.
Pet cats living near areas with nature also hunt more, reducing the value of places that should be safe havens for wildlife.

A hidden toll: Australia's cats kill almost 650 million reptiles a year
The 186 animals each pet cat kills per year on average is made up of 110 native animals (40 reptiles, 38 birds and 32 mammals).
For example, the critically endangered western ringtail possum is found in suburban areas of Mandurah, Bunbury, Busselton and Albany. The possum did not move into these areas – rather, we moved into their habitat.
What can pet owners do?
Keeping your cat securely contained 24 hours a day is the only way to prevent it from killing wildlife.
It’s a myth that a good diet or feeding a cat more meat will prevent hunting: even cats that aren’t hungry will hunt.
A bell on a cat’s collar doesn’t stop hunting, it only makes hunting a little harder.
Wes Mountain/The Conversation

Various devices, such as bells on collars, are commercially marketed with the promise of preventing hunting. While some of these items may reduce the rate of successful kills, they don’t prevent hunting altogether.
And they don’t prevent cats from disturbing wildlife. When cats prowl and hunt in an area, wildlife have to spend more time hiding or escaping. This reduces the time spent feeding themselves or their young, or resting.
In Mandurah, WA, the disturbance and hunting of just
one pet cat and one stray cat
caused the total breeding failure of a colony of more than 100 pairs of fairy terns.
Benefits of a life indoors
Keeping cats indoors protects pet cats from injury, avoids nuisance behaviour and prevents
unwanted breeding
.
Cats allowed outside often get into fights with other cats, even when they’re not the fighting type (they can be attacked by other cats when running away).
Two cats in Western Australia stopped fairy terns from breeding.

Roaming cats are also very prone to getting hit by a vehicle. According to the Humane Society of the United States, indoor cats
live up to four times longer
than those allowed to roam freely.
Indoor cats have lower rates of cat-borne diseases, some of which can infect humans. For example, in humans the cat-borne disease
toxoplasmosis
can cause illness, miscarriages and birth defects.

"Australian shelters and pounds kill 50,000 mostly healthy cats and kittens in a year. There’s a way to prevent this pointless killing",https://theconversation.com/australian-shelters-and-pounds-kill-50-000-mostly-healthy-cats-and-kittens-in-a-year-theres-a-way-to-prevent-this-pointless-killing-201947,"Stray cats are a longstanding problem in Australian towns and cities. Common complaints about roaming cats include nuisance (fighting and urinating), disease risks to humans and other animals, and predation of native wildlife. The huge numbers of cats and kittens taken in by animal shelters and council pounds are a challenge to manage, leading to an estimated 50,000 being killed each year – most of them young and healthy.
Our
newly published research
reveals Australian council pounds, rescue groups and animal welfare shelters took in 179,615 cats and kittens in 2018-2019. Of these animals, 5% were reclaimed by owners, 65% rehomed and 28% killed.
Council-operated pounds killed 46% of all cats and kittens admitted. Shelters killed 25%. One in four council pounds in New South Wales and Victoria killed a staggering 67-100%.
Despite the scale of this killing, Australia’s stray cat numbers are not decreasing. The evidence shows an urgent need for proactive
community cat programs
offering free desexing of cats in targeted problem areas.
Killing so many cats is bad for people too
High cat-killing rates also have a significant human cost. Many council,
shelter
and
veterinary
staff
suffer
devastating
psychological
impacts
when required to kill large numbers of healthy cats and kittens, often repeatedly. These impacts include trauma, depression, substance abuse and
increased suicide risk
.
Members of the public can also be
traumatised
when the stray cats they are feeding are trapped and killed.
More than one in four cats and kittens entering pounds and shelters are killed.

Current approaches are failing
To make matters worse, trapping and killing stray cats and kittens is costly and has not worked. This reactive approach has not reduced the stray cat population over the decades it has been applied. Therefore, the potential nuisance, disease risks and native wildlife predation have not been reduced.
Our research shows cat intakes actually increased at municipal pounds in NSW from 2016-17 to 2018-19 (pre-COVID data are most accurate). Attempts to adopt and kill our way out of the stray cat problem have failed.

Cats that are allowed to roam can spread diseases to humans and wildlife
Australian councils are increasingly adopting mandatory cat containment (curfews). It seems like a logical solution, but based on the evidence it is not effective. It doesn’t reduce stray cat numbers in the short or long term, as
shown by the experience
of councils such as
Casey
and
Yarra Ranges
in Victoria.
RSPCA Australia
acknowledges:
Overall, councils with cat containment regulations have not been able to demonstrate any measurable reduction in cat complaints or cats wandering at large.
In contrast,
Hume
,
Hobsons Bay
and
Merri-bek
councils in Victoria have rejected mandatory containment. Their decisions cited reasons such as it is ineffective and unenforceable because most stray cats don’t have an owner to contain them.
Cats may be owned, semi-owned (people feed them intentionally) or (uncommonly) unowned. In the latter case they get food unintentionally provided by people, such as from bins.
Even for owned cats, containment is
sometimes not achievable
due to factors such as housing limitations, cost – containment systems typically cost $700-$2,000 – and concerns about the welfare of confined cats. Mandatory containment creates a barrier to semi-owners adopting the stray cat they are feeding and also potentially criminalises cat ownership for disadvantaged families, particularly those in rental properties.
Containment to their owners’ properties should be strongly encouraged where cats’ physical and mental needs can be met. But mandatory containment should be rejected. It will not protect native wildlife, the commonly cited justification, because it does not measurably reduce the number of free-roaming cats.

Research reveals why pet owners keep their cats indoors – and it's not to protect wildlife
Stray cats are not feral cats
Based on
RSPCA
and
government
definitions
, stray cats in urban and urban fringe areas are all domestic cats.
They are not
feral cats
. Feral cats
live and breed in the wild
, not in cities or towns or near people, are not the subject of nuisance complaints and are
not admitted to shelters or pounds
. Stray cats are sometimes mislabelled as feral cats, which prevents effective solutions to the stray cat problem.
Stray cats account for 80-100% of admissions to
council pounds
and 60-80% to
animal welfare agencies
. The rest are mostly cats given up by their owners.
Most stray cats entering pounds and shelters are from poorer areas and are
likely semi-owned cats
. The people who feed them do not see themselves as owners of the stray cat but have an emotional bond with the cat.

So what’s the long-term solution?
Assisting semi-owners and owners in disadvantaged areas to desex their cats is the best long-term solution to the stray cat problem. The
Community Cat Program
is an evidence-based approach that supports cat owners and semi-owners with free desexing and microchipping of the cats they are caring for. These efforts should be focused on areas of high cat intakes and complaints.
Proactive
community cat programs
are
scientifically
proven
to reduce the number of stray cats and unwanted kittens in targeted areas. They  thereby reduce nuisance complaints, cat intake and killing, trauma to people, costs, disease risks and wildlife predation.
Banyule in Victoria set up a free program to desex, microchip and register owned and semi-owned cats, with a focus on suburbs with high cat-related calls.  In just three years, the council
reduced impoundments
by 61% and numbers killed by 74%. In contrast, after Yarra Ranges Council
implemented mandatory containment
in 2017, there was a 68% increase in impoundments in the third year.
The 2022 NSW
Rehoming Practices Review
recommended community cat programs, consistent with a “
One Welfare
” approach. The aim is to optimise and balance the wellbeing of people, animals and their social and physical environment. Earlier this year, the NSW government
announced
$8.3 million
in funding for community cat programs and facilities.
At least 50%
of cats entering pounds and shelters are kittens less than six months old. These figures highlight why community cat programs are urgently needed across Australia to protect cats, native wildlife and people."
"Street life ain’t easy for a stray cat, with most dying before they turn 1. So what’s the best way to deal with them?",https://theconversation.com/street-life-aint-easy-for-a-stray-cat-with-most-dying-before-they-turn-1-so-whats-the-best-way-to-deal-with-them-164796,"Odds are, if you’ve seen a cat prowling around your neighbourhood, it doesn’t have an owner. Australia is home to hordes of unowned cats, with an estimated
700,000
living without appropriate care in urban areas, around rubbish dumps or on farms.
Unowned cats are sometimes called
“stray” or “semi-feral”: they, or their parents, were once owned by humans but are now abandoned or lost. Unowned stray cats rely heavily on human settlements for food and shelter and breed freely. Feral cats, on the other hand, live in the wild and can survive without relying on people for food.
Like their feral counterparts, unowned cats are a public health threat, they can fight with or transmit diseases to pet cats, and they kill native wildlife. 
And, of course, they themselves suffer poor welfare. In fact, our recent
studies show
unowned cats have significantly shorter lives than pet cats, with less than half surviving their first year.
It’s vital we find effective ways to reduce their numbers — but what’s the best way to go about this?
Street cats have hard, short lives
Free-roaming cats have
hard lives on the streets
. Even when they’re owned by someone, things can come to a sticky end.
Numerous international studies report high death rates for roaming pet cats, with causes including
road accidents
and accidental
poisoning
. They’re also frequently injured or killed by
domestic dogs
.
Even Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s cat Paddles, the “first cat” of New Zealand, was
killed by a car
in 2017.
Unowned cats encounter the same issues and more, but without an owner to provide immediate veterinary attention. So it’s no surprise free-roaming unowned cats have low life expectancy.
We analysed the demographics of free-roaming unowned cats in Perth, Western Australia. The
145 unowned cats
we studied had significantly shorter lives than the
899 pet cats
in Perth. The median age of unowned cats was just eight to ten months. By contrast, the median age for pet cats was about five years.
Author provided
The unowned cats in our study looked healthy, were reproductive, and had few external parasites. However, these animals were the ones that had survived long enough to be trapped and studied. Cats often
hide when traumatised or ill
, and so sick cats will often
just “disappear”
.
Alarmingly, 58% of the cats we examined had
consumed dangerous refuse
, including sharp, dangerous items or indigestible material that blocked their gastrointestinal tracts.
Nearly all
(95%) carried substantial loads of transmissible helminth parasites.

Don't let them out: 15 ways to keep your indoor cat happy
Across Australia’s states and territories, there are two main approaches local governments use to manage unowned cat populations in urban and regional areas: trap and euthanase or trap and adopt.
Another approach is to trap, desex and return cats to their point of capture (called “trap-neuter-return”). Although this is currently being undertaken by private individuals and groups in capital cities and some towns, it is
considered illegal
across most jurisdictions in Australia, as it is construed as abandonment or releasing an invasive species.
Desexing cats is an important way to curb the numbers of unowned cats on the streets. But cats shouldn’t be returned to where they were found.

1. Euthanasia
In most parts of the country, where problems with unowned cats have been reported, they are trapped and removed. This normally means euthanasia.
For example, in Brisbane, a council program that ran since 2013 efficiently
reduced the numbers of unowned cats
with euthanasia, with complaints about stray cats falling from about 140 to just ten per year, over five years.
But high rates of euthanasia for unowned cats can be problematic for many people, especially for veterinarians undertaking the task.
It can be traumatic and challenging
to euthanise healthy cats just because they are unwanted.
Read more:
Why your veterinarian may refuse to euthanise your pet
2. Trap-neuter-return programs
Some believe desexing cats and returning them to street life, with supplementary feeding, is a solution to large numbers of unwanted cats, because it avoids euthanasia.
But overseas studies have shown trap-neuter-return programs encourage
abandonment
of unwanted cats at feeding stations. Numbers of cats can actually go up, despite best efforts.
And what is the quality of life for returned cats? Given the difficult, short lives of free-roaming cats, trap-neuter-return programs are arguably a less ethical choice with poor welfare outcomes for the cats themselves. There have even been
calls in Japan
to revise trap-neuter-return policies on account of poor health and well-being of the cats.
Returning neutered animals to where they were found may also
violate state laws
. Enforcing these laws is critical to reduce unowned cat populations, improve the welfare of cats, and discourage dumping of unwanted pets.
Unowned cats are often found around rubbish dumps, searching for food.

3. Adopt a cat
In May, the ACT government released an ambitious and targeted
ten-year plan
with the vision that, by 2031, “all cats in the ACT will be owned, wanted and cared for by responsible owners”. It is an exemplar of what the community can do to improve the lives of cats, and we believe it should be modelled elsewhere in Australia.
The plan has been developed to raise best practice standards, recognising the duty of care needed to ensure the health and well-being of cats.
This starts with responsible owners. It calls for improved compliance with compulsory desexing and registration. To encourage people to comply, the ACT government will be implementing free or low-cost desexing and free microchipping. Compulsory containment for new cats acquired after July 1, 2022 is also on the cards.
The plan provides a strategy to trap roaming cats, with improvements in how pet cats can be identified and returned to their owners, while unowned neighbourhood cats will be put up for adoption.
Adopting a cat is the most compassionate way to bring the number of roaming unowned cats down.
Shutterstock
So what do we do about it?
Well, we know two tasks are critical: removing unowned cats from the streets, and reducing unwanted breeding and abandonment of cats.
Trap-neuter-return programs can do more harm than good because cats still live a hard life on the streets and may lead to some people feeling comfortable abandoning unwanted cats at the release sites. And while euthanasia has been shown to be effective, it can be a difficult choice.
Instead, Australia must boost efforts to socialise and
adopt
unowned cats, and enforce laws that stop owned cats free-roaming the streets. This will require enormous effort with community education, but it is a compassionate choice addressing all problems caused by free-roaming cats (both owned and unowned).
If you’re inspired to give a cat a “furrever” home, contact your nearest cat welfare organisation or local council. And if you already have a pet cat, it’s important to keep it on your property all day, every day — not only to
protect native wildlife
, but to
protect the cats themselves

Some people will think measures like these are draconian. But keeping cats inside can actually
be in the best interests
of the cat, as well as the environment.
Outdoor cats die sooner
Cats live
substantially longer
, safer lives if environmental dangers of free-roaming are eliminated. An exclusively inside (or contained outside) life precludes the chance of many common and important causes of life-threatening trauma.
The most significant risk is being
injured or killed by a vehicle

Other animals can prey on cats. Dogs are the most common risk, and your local vet can testify to the horrendous injuries cats suffer when they’re bailed up by dogs.
Venomous snakes

Tick paralysis
is also a risk in some areas.

Cats, especially sexually intact males, are territorially aggressive and fight among themselves. And cats that fight are commonly infected by the feline immunodeficiency virus which can spread, along with other viral and bacterial pathogens, through the
transfer of blood
during fighting.
What’s more, free-roaming cats who catch mice and rats that have eaten poison baits can become poisoned secondarily. Other things are also toxic to cats, such as
lilies
and anti-freeze, and some cats are maliciously poisoned.
But is denying cats ‘the outside’ also cruel?
The bottom line
is most cats can be totally happy living indoors – but owners need to put in the effort to provide for their environmental and behavioural needs.
Cat trees provide opportunities for scratching, climbing and jumping up and down.
Shutterstock
But a
2019 survey
with more than 12,000 respondents found many Australian cat owners are not adequately providing for their indoor cats, especially when it comes to toileting and feeding.
This may lead to a range of health and welfare issues, such as obesity and related diseases, behavioural problems and urinary tract disorders.
For example, cats are very fastidious when it comes to toileting, so you need to give them nice clean litter trays (they don’t want to use a place they think another cat has soiled). Cats don’t like to eat near their toilet, so separate their litter trays and feeding area in different rooms. They also need choice, so more than one litter tray is required.
Raw chicken drumsticks promote good oral hygiene for cats.

Welfare problems can also arise if indoor cats cannot satiate specific natural desires and behaviours.
For example, cats love to climb and jump, and they like to sharpen their nails. You need to provide the opportunity to perform these activities indoors with a range of cat furniture.

Pets and owners - you can learn a lot about one by studying the other
Here’s a list of simple ways (
taken from a larger study
) you can make inside a happy place for your cat, even if you live in a small apartment.
Cleanliness and eating habits
have one litter tray per cat, plus one (for instance, three litter trays for two cats), in different locations, in quiet areas of the house. Clay litter is best. Scoop out faeces and urine soiled litter on at least a twice-daily basis and change the whole tray once a week. Have one litter tray covered (for privacy) and the other open – cats like variety
regular grooming with your cat’s favourite grooming brush is fun and feels like a massage. It’s good for the coat and prevents hairballs and matted fur
Regular grooming prevents mats in the coat and leads to fewer hairballs.
Author provided
consider providing some natural food
such as raw
chicken drum sticks
. Raw meat requires chewing, massaging the gums and provides cats with a sense of possession. Some cats will even “kill” the drumstick by banging it on the ground a few times before eating. Nothing settles a cat more than knocking off a drumstick.
Setting up the space
cats need
vertical space
more than horizontal space. So consider a ladder or other objects to let them climb to the top of a wardrobe or the fridge. Use cat furniture which expands vertical space
Cats like to curl up somewhere warm, such as near a heater or in a sunny spot.

cats like windows
so they can check out what’s happening outside. Have stands located so they can look out
cats love multiple points of safety and seclusion. Set up several cat baskets lined with a soft blanket or igloos, and ideally at different heights (for example, a few at ground level and one nice and high – maybe on top of a wardrobe)
cats have a
higher thermoneutral temperature
than dogs and people, so they seek out warm places. Place some baskets in the sun, or a basket in front of the heater
have good border security. Windows need fly screens to keep cats inside. If not, the “
high rise syndrome
” – where cats drop from a height of two or more stories – can lead to severe injuries. Front doors need automatic closing mechanisms to stop cats getting outside
provide
cat with scratching towers
for exercise, and to satiate its desire to sharpen its claws. Vertical and horizontal scratching surfaces should be provided. Better here than on the good furniture
Vertical space is more important than horizontal space for a cat.
Author provided (no reuse)
consider installing a
modular pet park
(outdoor cat enclosures) or similar contained outdoor setup, which gives the cat an outdoor experience but without risks.
Keep them entertained
the ideal number of cats is usually one or two. Having
two littermates
is often ideal, as they are more likely get on and keep each other company when you’re not at home. A single cat will usually just sleep while you’re away and look forward to you coming home. Three or more cats are not recommended as they do not invariably get along which can cause more health and welfare issues
cat toys
can provide fun and exercise, and they don’t need to be expensive. A ping pong ball is cheap. Scrunched up paper is very popular.
Cat exercise wheels
are costly, but can be a lot of fun and provide good exercise
puzzle feeders
that hide food are also a fun toy for curious cats and can recreate the hunting behaviour of searching for food

Thinking of getting a second cat? Here’s how to make sure your first pet doesn’t feel threatened,https://theconversation.com/thinking-of-getting-a-second-cat-heres-how-to-make-sure-your-first-pet-doesnt-feel-threatened-199218,"Many people choose to live with a cat for companionship. As a
social species
, companionship is something we often crave. But this
cannot necessarily be said
of our feline friends. Domestic cats evolved from a largely solitary species, defending their territory from other cats.
Although modern-day cats
can live together in friendly groups
(when there are enough resources to go around),
bonds generally only develop
between cats who are related or grow up together. It is natural for cats to feel threatened by unfamiliar cats. Owners should consider whether adding another cat to their home is really in their cat’s best interest,
especially if they are generally more of a timid cat
.
If you’re set on adding another cat to your home, plan the introduction carefully.
Prepare for your new cat before you bring them home. Set aside a room for them, making sure they have at least two comfortable sleeping areas, a water bowl, a feeding area, scratching post and toys. Provide at least one litter tray (preferably two), well away from the food, water and sleeping places.
When the day comes to bring your new cat home, take them straight to “their” room. Allow them to come out of their carrier in their own time. They will be frightened
if you try to pull them out
. No matter how excited you are to interact with your new companion, you might need to leave the room, allowing them to explore by themselves.
Cats feel safer if they can access elevated surfaces.

Scent swapping
Your new cat needs to stay in their room for several days. This will help them settle down and allows you to introduce them to your existing cat via scent.
Scent, especially facial pheromones, helps cats identify other cats that they are bonded with and
is important for maintaining bonds
between cats. Swap cloths that each cat has slept on, and toys. Place these somewhere the cats will come across them in their own rooms, but away from beds, bowls and litter trays.
Neither cat should show signs of avoidance or aggression towards the cloths before you progress. Then you can directly swap scent between the cats. Stroke one cat, especially around the cheeks and area in front of the ears, and then go directly to the other cat and stroke them. Repeat in the other direction.
This will transfer the cats’ scent profiles and facial pheromones, as if they were rubbing on each other directly. Look for
relaxed rubbing or nudging
in return.
Not all cats will be happy to share a bed.

Longer term
Once both cats are relaxed about being stroked with your other cat’s scent on your hands, they can finally see each other and your new cat can explore the rest of your home. You can buy a plug-in diffuser that releases copies of a feline facial pheromone, which may help with the initial introductions as it has been found to
reduce cat-to-cat aggression within households
.
There should be lots of escape routes for the cats to move away from each other. Make sure there is a cat tower or furniture, like a bookshelf, to jump onto and that the cats can easily leave the room if they want to. Cats
like to hide away if threatened
and to get up high.
Each cat needs their own scratching surface to maintain good claw and muscle condition.
Evgenia Terekhova/Shutterstock
Initially, shut the cat you adopted first away in a separate room and allow your new cat out of theirs to explore. Once they are familiar with the layout of the house and where escape routes and safe places are, you can let your other cat out. Supervise the cats and be ready to intervene if tensions start to mount.
Watch for any avoidant or agonistic behaviour, such as running away and hiding, ears going back or hissing. Never punish your cat for aggressive behaviour and avoid using food to lure the cats closer together. Cats are solitary hunters and
would not naturally eat in close proximity
to other cats, even ones they are bonded with.
Because cats can find it challenging to form new relationships with other cats, especially as adults, your cats may never become best friends. To reduce conflict, make sure both cats can access food, water and litter trays without having to pass each other.
As a general rule, you will need to have one more of each resource than the total number of cats in the household. For example, three litter trays for a two-cat household. If your cats go outside, it may also be helpful to
provide more than one entrance and exit point
, as the cat flap is another common area for conflict between cats.
Cats and dogs can also form close bonds.
Chendongshan/Shutterstock
Similar advice applies if you want to add another companion species to your home, such as a puppy. Introductions may be more successful if the puppy is carefully and gradually introduced
before they’re 12 weeks old
.
Don’t allow your puppy to chase your cat. Reward the puppy for calm behaviour. Your cat should never feel cornered and always have the choice to move away from any interaction, whether that’s with a human or non-human animal."
Won’t my cat get bored if I keep it inside? Here’s how to ensure it’s happy,https://theconversation.com/wont-my-cat-get-bored-if-i-keep-it-inside-heres-how-to-ensure-its-happy-214562,"The
Australian
and
American Veterinary Medical Association
s recommend keeping cats indoors because
they
, and
wildlife
, will be safer.
However, a
boring indoor environment
may not meet a cat’s need for mental stimulation. So how can we keep cats indoors in a way that will keep them safe
and
happy?
When considering animal welfare, the
Five Domains Model
is a good place to start. The five domains are:
nutrition – cats need the right type and amounts of food and water
physical environment, including temperature, flooring, noise, light
health – injury, disease, impairment
behavioural interactions with people and other animals, which includes the ability to exercise agency – choosing to engage, or not, in a particular activity at a given moment
mental state, including feelings such as hunger, pain, fear and comfort, which is an overall assessment of the animal’s subjective welfare state.
Keeping a cat indoors denies it the choice of being inside or outside. The sense of control an animal has over its life is an
important aspect of its welfare
, so how can we compensate for this loss of agency?
Several ways to help meet your cat’s needs are available at various price points. Most help meet the cat’s behavioural needs. Some also touch on other needs like environment or nutrition. All will contribute to your cat’s wellbeing.

Free solutions
If you’re feeling the pinch of the
cost-of-living crisis
, you can still provide your cat with plenty of enrichment for free, or at very low cost. There are multiple options.
Cat music
has some
scientific evidence
behind it and is available on
YouTube
. This will help meet their environmental needs.
An example of the cat music available on YouTube.
Puzzle feeders
, which you can buy or make yourself. Cats are predators, so they are biologically wired to work for their food. Puzzle feeders can be a good way to help meet this biological need.
These feeders don’t have to be expensive. One homemade example is an egg carton with the cat’s food inside and the lid closed, so the cat must find a way to open the carton to obtain the food.
Start with a simple puzzle, and gradually build to more complex puzzles. Only do puzzle feeding if your cat is a good eater and not underweight, though. This will help meet their nutritional and behavioural needs.
Boxes
, which cats love to sit in. This hiding behaviour
appears to reduce stress
Cats will even sit in
boxes that don’t technically exist
– such as outlines on a floor. This will help meet their behavioural needs.
Clicker training
uses a small noise-making device to indicate that the animal has performed a desired behaviour. While more commonly known for dogs, it
can also be used in cats
.
Read more:
Why you should train your cat – and how to do it
Cats can benefit from the interest and activities that clicker training can provide.
“Do as I do” training
is another option. In this training style, the cat
learns to mimic your behaviour
, but in a species-appropriate way. For instance, if you stood on your tiptoes and raised your arms, your cat would stand on its hind legs and lift the front paws. This will be good for their behavioural needs.
Playing
with a pet cat for at least five minutes at a time has been
associated with reduced behaviour problems
, so play with them to help meet their needs.
New objects/scents
will help meet their environmental needs. Cats enjoy novelty as long as there is also plenty of predictability in their environment. Regularly bringing new things or scents like catnip into your home
may be interesting for your cat
.

Harness walks

Using a harness is a way to safely walk your cat outdoors.

Toys that move erratically
are preferable to static toys. These can be toys that you move yourself such as a toy mouse that you move around on the floor. The movement may appeal to the cat’s predatory nature.
Puzzle feeders
can be made very cheaply (see above), but you can buy one too. It can provide interesting variety for cats, especially after they’ve had some puzzle experience. Again, only do this with cats who are good eaters and are not underweight.
A scratching post
should
ideally be vertical or inclined

generally preferable
to horizontal surfaces. Chenille, rope or cardboard appear to be the
preferred materials

Cats first finagled their way into human hearts and homes thousands of years ago – here’s how,https://theconversation.com/cats-first-finagled-their-way-into-human-hearts-and-homes-thousands-of-years-ago-heres-how-208909,"A few years ago, I had the opportunity to go on safari in southern Africa. One of the greatest thrills was going out at night looking for predators on the prowl: lions, leopards, hyenas.
As we drove through the darkness, though, our spotlight occasionally lit up a smaller hunter – a slender, tawny feline, faintly spotted or striped. The glare would catch the small cat for a moment before it darted back into the shadows.
An African wildcat doesn’t look so different from a domestic cat.
pum_eva/iStock via Getty Images Plus
Based on its size and appearance, I initially presumed it was someone’s pet inexplicably out in the bush. But further scrutiny revealed distinctive features: legs slightly longer than those of most domestic cats, and a striking black-tipped tail. Still, if you saw one from your kitchen window, your first thought would be “Look at that beautiful cat in the backyard,” not “How’d that African wildcat get to New Jersey?”
As an evolutionary biologist
, I’ve spent my career
studying how species adapt to their environment
. My research has been reptile-focused, investigating the workings of
natural selection
on lizards.
Yet, I’ve always loved and been fascinated by felines, ever since we adopted a shelter cat when I was 5 years old. And the more I’ve thought about those African wildcats, the more I’ve marveled at their evolutionary success. The species’ claim to fame is simple: The
African wildcat is the ancestor
of our beloved household pets. And despite changing very little, their descendants have become among the world’s two most popular companion animals. (Numbers are fuzzy, but the global population of
cats
and
dogs
approaches a billion for each.)
Clearly, the few evolutionary changes the domestic cat has made have been the right ones to wangle their way into people’s hearts and homes. How did they do it? I explored this question in my book “
The Cat’s Meow: How Cats Evolved from the Savanna to Your Sofa
.”
Why the African wildcat?
Big cats – like lions, tigers and pumas – are the attention-grabbing celebrities of the feline world. But of the
41 species of wild felines
, the vast majority are about the size of a housecat. Few people have heard of the black-footed cat or the Borneo bay cat, much less the kodkod, oncilla or marbled cat. Clearly, the little-cat side of the feline family needs a better PR agent.
In theory, any of these species could have been the progenitor of the domestic cat, but
recent DNA studies demonstrate unequivocally
that today’s housecats arose from the African wildcat – specifically, the North African subspecies,
Felis silvestris lybica
.
Given the profusion of little pusses, why was the North African wildcat the one to give rise to our household companions?
In short, it was the right species in the right place at the right time.
Civilization began
in the
Fertile Crescent
about 10,000 years ago, when people first settled into villages and started growing food.
This area – spanning parts of modern-day Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iran and more – is
home to numerous small cats
, including the caracal, serval, jungle cat and sand cat. But of these, the African wildcat is the one that to this day enters villages and
can be found around humans
.
African wildcats are among the friendliest of feline species; raised gently, they
can make affectionate companions
. In contrast, despite the most tender attention, their close relative the European wildcat
grows up to be hellaciously mean
.
Given these tendencies, it’s easy to
envision what likely happened
. People settled down and started raising crops, storing the excess for lean times. These granaries led to rodent population explosions. Some African wildcats – those with the least fear of humans – took advantage of this bounty and started hanging around. People saw the benefit of their presence and treated the cats kindly, perhaps giving them shelter or food. The boldest cats entered huts and perhaps allowed themselves to be petted – kittens are adorable! – and, voilà, the domestic cat was born.

Where exactly domestication occurred – if it was a single place and not simultaneously throughout the entire region – is unclear. But
tomb paintings and sculptures
show that by 3,500 years ago, domestic cats lived in Egypt.
Genetic analysis
– including
DNA from Egyptian cat mummies
– and archaeological data chart the feline diaspora. They moved northward through Europe (and ultimately to North America), south deeper into Africa and eastward to Asia. Ancient DNA even demonstrates that
Vikings played a role in spreading felines
far and wide.
What cat traits did domestication emphasize?
Domestic cats possess many colors, patterns and hair textures not seen in wildcats. Some
cat breeds
have distinctive physical features, like
munchkins’ short legs
,
Siameses’ elongated faces
or
Persians’ lack of muzzle
.
A fluffy, flat-faced Persian cat has changed a lot in looks from its wildcat ancestor.

Yet many domestics appear basically indistinguishable from wildcats. In fact, only
13 genes have been changed by natural selection
during the domestication process. By contrast,
almost three times as many genes changed
during the descent of dogs from wolves.
There are only two ways to indisputably identify a wildcat. You can measure the size of its brain –
housecats
,
like other domestic animals
, have evolved reductions in the parts of the brain associated with aggression, fear and overall reactivity. Or you can measure the length of its intestines –
longer in domestic cats
to digest vegetable-based food provided by or scavenged from humans.
The most significant evolutionary changes during cat domestication involve their behavior. The common view that domestic cats are aloof loners couldn’t be further from the truth. When lots of domestic cats live together – in places where humans provide copious amounts of food –
they form social groups very similar to lion prides
. Composed of related females, these cats are very friendly – grooming, playing with and lying on top of each other, nursing each other’s kittens, even serving as midwives during birth.
To signal friendly intentions,
an approaching cat raises its tail straight up
, a trait shared with lions and no other feline species. As anyone who has lived with a cat knows, they use this “I want to be friends” message toward people as well, indicating that they include us in their social circle.
Cats use plenty of tools and tricks to get you to hand over what they want.

Evolution of a master manipulator
Household cats are quite vocal to their human companions, using
different meows to communicate different messages
. Unlike the tail-up display, however, this is not an example of their treating us as part of their clan. Quite the contrary,
cats rarely meow to one another
.
The sound of these meows has
evolved during domestication
to more effectively communicate with us. Listeners rate the wildcat’s call as more urgent and demanding (“Mee‑O‑O‑O‑O‑O‑W!”) compared with the domestic cat’s more pleasing (“MEE‑ow”). Scientists suggest that these shorter, higher-pitched sounds are
more pleasing to our auditory system
, perhaps because young humans have high-pitched voices, and domestic cats have evolved accordingly to curry human favor.
Cats similarly
manipulate people with their purrs
. When they want something – picture a cat rubbing against your legs in the kitchen while you open a can of wet food – they purr extra loudly. And this purr is not the agreeable thrumming of a content cat, but an insistent chainsaw br-rr-oom demanding attention.
Scientists digitally compared the spectral qualities of the
two types of purrs
and discovered that the major difference is that the insistent purr includes a component very similar to the sound of a human baby crying. People, of course, are
innately attuned to this sound
, and cats have evolved to take advantage of this sensitivity to get our attention.
Of course, that won’t surprise anyone who’s lived with a cat.
Although cats are very trainable
– they’re very food motivated – cats usually train us more than we train them. As the old saw goes, “Dogs have owners, cats have staff.”"
"Do cats have ‘friends’, or do they always vie for territory? Animal experts weigh in",https://theconversation.com/do-cats-have-friends-or-do-they-always-vie-for-territory-animal-experts-weigh-in-249013,"Domestic cats have been living alongside humans for an
estimated 10,000 years
, first as rodent control and then as the couch-warmers we know and love. A far cry from the
lone predator lifestyle of their ancestors
, today millions of cats worldwide live within human families. More than 30% of households in the
United States
and
Australia
own a cat.
We highly value the relationships we share with these furry companions, frequently considering them
friends, family members or even “children”
.
And this sentiment may be shared, with cats
demonstrating affection
through seeking out our company, physical contact and engaging in play. Like a secret language between friends, there is even
evidence
to suggest cats have developed specific vocalisations to communicate with their owners.
Despite this, cats are typically seen as
aloof and elusive
. But how true is this? Do cats form friendships beyond us?
A complex recipe
Firstly, what does a cat friendship
look like
? Behaviours that may indicate
friendship
between two cats include social grooming, such as licking each other’s fur, head rubbing, spending time together and playing together.
In contrast, behaviours such as charging, fighting or chasing may indicate a
disagreement
is brewing or already underway.
Cats also have very few
“conflict defusing” signals
in their behavioural repertoire, choosing to run away or avoid each other rather than attempt reconciliation during conflict.
Such disharmony can be
stressful for the cats
. Many owners end up wondering how to maximise the chances of fostering a positive relationship between their cat and other animals – or if they should get them a “friend” at all.
Successful cat friendships can be tricky to achieve.

The recipe for successful feline friendships is a little complex. Research on cat dynamics in unowned, free-ranging cats has found close relationships are more likely to form – and last – if they are:
both female
grow up together
are
closely related
and
live in close proximity
to one another.
Indoor-only cats can also form strong friendships with other cats in the household. Similar to unowned free-ranging cats, cats who have been introduced to one another at a
young age
, who are
related
, and who have
lived together for a long-time
, are more likely to be close friends.
However, among de-sexed cats,
male pairs show closer bonds
than male-female pairs.
Female pairs are the least likely to be friends
.
Their
first introduction
is also the most
predictive factor
for positive long-term relationships.
What about outdoor friends?
We know less about the social lives of pet cats that are allowed to roam outside, but the default behaviour for most cats is one of
competitiveness
and
territorialism
.
That said, cats will typically try to avoid confrontations with others.
While some research has found interactions between roaming cats are
usually calm
, they can and do sometimes result in fights – particularly if food is around or they venture into an unfamiliar
unowned cats’ territory
.
To complicate things further,
two cats are more likely to fight
within a household if they are allowed outside – likely due to bringing in unfamiliar scents.
We also can’t forget the
problematic relationship
cats can have with native fauna, sometimes decimating local wildlife populations. In many places, especially in parts of Australia, cats are not allowed outdoors for this reason.
There are also dangers to their
own health and safety
if allowed to roam, such as misadventure, risks from road traffic or even disgruntled neighbours.
Cats are territorial, but typically avoid confrontations with others.

Cats and dogs … in harmony?
While research has mainly explored cats’ friendship with each other, cats can also have positive relationships with other species. For example, while cats and dogs are commonly depicted as mortal enemies, they can live harmoniously, often
sleeping and playing together
.
However, once again the importance of
early exposure
and
slow introductions
in developing this relationship cannot be overstated.
Interestingly, it also appears that
indoor cats
are friendlier towards their canine companions than cats allowed outdoors. This is possibly because outdoor cats may be exposed to multiple dogs, many of which aren’t happy to see them.
Cats can have positive relationships with other species – like Alfie the cat who comes to visit Bingo the dog every day.
The Conversation
Who’s your cat’s closest friend?
So, should your pet cat have a friend? As you may have guessed by now, the answer to cat friendships is complicated.
If you do plan to introduce your cat to a new companion, here are some
suggestions to follow
. Firstly, cat introductions should be slow and supervised to increase the chance of a positive first meeting.
Your house
should also have plenty of safe spaces, toys and puzzle feeders, scratching posts, and separate food and litter areas in a quiet spot. Providing these resources will help prevent resource guarding (where cats stop other cats from accessing things they need or like) and reduce conflict between the animals.
At the end of the day, while cats can form friendships with other animals, they aren’t crucial to their health and happiness.
Your cat’s closest relationship is the one it has with you. Ensuring they have lots of opportunities to
bask in your attention
and
engage in play
is likely enough for even the most social of felines. After all, they have their “aloof and elusive” reputations to uphold."
Can your cat recognise you by scent? New study shows it’s likely,https://theconversation.com/can-your-cat-recognise-you-by-scent-new-study-shows-its-likely-257614,"Ever wonder if your cat could pick you out of a line up?
New research suggests they could … but maybe not in the way you would expect.
Previous research has found that only
54% of cats
could recognise humans by their face alone.
So how
does
your cat know it’s you?
Studying the sniff
A new
study published today in PLOS One
suggests your cat can recognise you by your smell. This feat has not been studied before and may reveal another layer of depth within cat-human bonds.
Cats often get a bad rap for being aloof or uncaring about the people in their lives, but a growing number of studies are finding the opposite to be true. We now know that cats learn the
names
we give them, cats and their guardians form their own
communication style
, and most cats will pick human social interaction over food, a choice even
dogs
struggle with.
And now, thanks to this most recent study, we know that cats can identify their people by smell, something they also rely on to identify their close
feline social groups
.
The study, by Yutaro Miyairi and colleagues at Tokyo University of Agriculture, investigated the ability of 30 cats to differentiate between their guardian and an unknown person based on scent alone.
Cats in the study were presented with a plastic tube containing swab samples from under the armpit, behind the ear and between the toes of either the cat’s guardian or of a human they had never met. As a control, cats were also presented with an empty plastic tube.
The results?
Cats in the study spent longer sniffing the scent of an unknown person compared to the scent of their guardian or the empty tube.
A shorter sniffing time suggests that when cats came across the smell of their guardian, they recognised it quickly and moved along. But when they came to the swabs from an unknown person, the cat sniffed longer, using their superior sense of smell to gather information about the scent.
Similar patterns have been observed previously, with
kittens
sniffing the odour of unknown female cats longer than the odour of their own mother, and
adult cats
sniffing the faeces of unfamiliar cats longer than those within their social group.
The findings of this new study may indicate that we, too, are in our cats’ social circle.
Cats do use their sense of smell to tell apart familiar and unfamiliar cats.

The brain and the nose
The study also found a tendency for cats to sniff familiar scents with their left nostril, while unknown scents were more often sniffed using their right. But when cats became familiar with a scent after sniffing for a while, they switched nostrils from the right to the left.
While this may sound like an odd finding, it’s a pattern that has also been observed in
dogs
. Current
research
suggests this nostril preference may indicate that cats process and classify new information using their right brain hemisphere, while the left hemisphere takes over when a routine response is established.
Cats will sniff things with different nostrils depending on whether the information is familiar or not.

Why scent?
Cats rely on scent to gather information about the world around them and to
communicate
.
Scent exchange (through cheek-to-cheek rubbing and grooming each other) is used as a way to recognise cats in the same
social circle
, maintain
group cohesion
, and identify unfamiliar cats or other animals that may pose a threat or need to be
avoided
.
Familiar scents can also be
comforting
to cats, reducing stress and anxiety and creating a sense of security within their environment.
When you come back from a holiday, if you notice your cat being distant and acting like you’re a total stranger, it might be because you smell like one. Try taking a shower using your usual home products and put on some of your regular home clothing. The familiar scents should help you and your cat settle back into your old dynamic sooner.
And remember, if your cat spends a lot of time sniffing someone else, it’s not because they prefer them. It’s likely because your scent is familiar and requires less work. Instead of being new and interesting, it might do something even better: help your cat feel at home."
Do cats make good therapy animals? The new trend showing felines may be more complicated than we realise,https://theconversation.com/do-cats-make-good-therapy-animals-the-new-trend-showing-felines-may-be-more-complicated-than-we-realise-254507,"Dogs are sociable, enthusiastic and widely used to comfort people in settings like hospitals, schools and care homes. But an
increasingly popular
alternative is emerging:
therapy cats
.
The term is often used loosely in the media and inconsistently within the scientific community. But in its strictest sense,
animal-assisted therapy
is a structured activity delivered by health professionals with clinical goals.
Most cats involved in this kind of work are part of broader
animal-assisted services
. For simplicity, we will stick with “therapy cat” throughout this article.
Therapy cats
are used to
alleviate loneliness and stress
. They are used in prisons, schools, hospices, care homes and hospitals and
are recommended for people
who are afraid of dogs or might struggle to interact with large animals like horses.
Therapy cats are becoming increasingly popular.

The environments therapy cats are often taken into, such as nursing homes or schools, can be noisy, unpredictable, and filled with unfamiliar people and surroundings. These are precisely the kinds of settings that
can unsettle
a typical cat.
Cats usually prefer predictability and stable surroundings. Similar to their wildcat ancestors, domestic cats
prioritise territorial security
over social bonds with people or other cats. Cats rely on scent to
navigate and feel secure
in their surroundings. The F3 pheromone helps them mark areas as “safe” or “known”, creating a kind of olfactory map of their home range.
Yet recent social media trends suggest a shift in our understanding. Increasingly, we see cats travelling alongside their owners in a
campervan
, via plane or
even on motorbikes
. These cats appear to tolerate, and sometimes even thrive, in environments animal behaviour experts once assumed were too stressful for them. So, what makes these cats different?
Some cats can benefit from the presence of a trusted human in unfamiliar or potentially stressful environments. In a 2021 study, animal behaviour researcher
Alexandra Behnke and colleagues
found that nearly half of the 42 cats they tested showed signs of the secure base effect, a bond that helps reduce stress and encourages exploration when reunited with their owner. This could be helping therapy cats cope with new environments.
A
recent study
led by Joni Delanoeije, a Belgian researcher in human-animal interaction, explored how cats selected for animal-assisted services differ from the average household pet. The study analysed survey responses relating to 474 cats - 12 of which had participated in such services. Cats involved in animal-assisted services were found to be more sociable with both people and other cats, were more attention-seeking and less resistant to being restrained.
These findings suggest that behavioural traits, like sociability and tolerance, may make some cats better suited to interacting with people in unfamiliar settings. However, the small number of cats actually involved in service work in this study means that we need more research to draw firm conclusions.
These cats also have strong, trusting bonds with their handlers. Early socialisation and gradual exposure seem to be essential for preparing cats to cope with the unpredictable nature of service work.
However, even with these qualities, cats may still face challenges in therapy environments. In a
2023 global study
of cat-assisted services, US psychologists Taylor Griffin and Lori Kogan found that even well-adapted cats may struggle in practice.
The study found that 68% of handlers had ended visits early when they deemed it best for the cat. Handlers in this study also described strong bonds with their cats - a relationship probably key to the cat’s ability to adapt, offering a sense of safety and predictability in a potentially stressful setting.
Cats can help people feel less lonely.

How do therapy cats compare to dogs?
Cats are different from dogs in their social needs, temperament and tolerance for change. These differences must be carefully considered during selection for therapy work - but with their differences come advantages. For example, therapy cats may provide more benefits to people that see themselves as “cat people”.
Research has shown
that this self-classification is linked to personality traits, with cat people often being more independent, creative and self-sufficient. Dog people tend to be more outgoing, sociable and group-oriented. Cat lovers might feel more at ease in one-to-one therapeutic settings, while dog lovers could prefer group-based activities.
Species preferences can also affect emotional responses. In
a 2022 study
, researcher Jovita Lukšaite and colleagues used facial expression software to analyse participants’ reactions to animal images.
Both cat and dog images triggered similar levels of happiness on average, yet dog images evoked significantly more fear. Fear of dogs could reduce the effectiveness of canine-assisted therapy for some, making cats a valuable alternative.
Dogs may excel at providing emotional support through physical interaction but cat purrs are a unique characteristic that may offer therapeutic benefits.
A 2001 study
found that domestic cats purr at a frequency between 25 and 50 hertz – a frequency that promotes healing in humans.
While there is a lack of more recent research to support this finding,
a 2021 study
found that cat owners reported that their cat’s purrs had a calming effect.
So, dogs might be the traditional therapy animal, but cats have shown they too have what it takes. With the right temperament and training, cats can offer something different to those in need of comfort."
Are cats good for our health?,https://theconversation.com/are-cats-good-for-our-health-238993,"Cats have lived with humans for
thousands of years
. And
long before
cat memes and viral
TikToks
took over the internet, they’ve been comforting us with their purrs and making us laugh with their weird antics.
But what does the research say – are cats good for us?
Living with a cat can have a profound – and sometimes surprising – effect on our physical and mental health. Still, living with cats is not without risks.
Part of the family
You may have heard cats don’t have owners, they have “staff”. In fact, multiple studies show the humans who live with them feel more like beloved relatives.
In a
study
of 1,800 Dutch cat owners, half said their cat was family. One in three viewed their cat as a child or best friend and found them loyal, supportive and empathetic.
Another US study developed a “
family bondedness
” scale and found cats were just as important a part of families as dogs.

A sense of purpose
Owning a pet is associated with
less social isolation
. And
some cat owners
say “providing for the cat” increases their feelings of enjoyment and sense of purpose.
But the benefits of the relationship may depend on how you relate to your cat.
One study
looked at different relationship styles between humans and cats, including “remote”, “casual” and “co-dependent”. It found people whose relationship with their cat was co-dependent or like a friend had a higher emotional connection to their pet.
Links to heart health
People who own – or have owned – a cat have a
lower risk
of dying from cardiovascular diseases such as stroke or heart disease. This result has been repeated in several
studies
.
However a problem interpreting population studies is they only tell us about an association. This means while people with cats have lower risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases, we can’t say for sure cats are the cause.
People who own a cat – or have in the past – are at lower risk of stroke and heart disease.

Cat ownership has also been associated with some positive changes in the
gut microbiota
, especially in women, such as improved blood glucose control and reduced inflammation.
Helping mental health
Having cat or dog is also associated with
higher psychological well-being
. For people with depression, patting or playing with their cat
has been shown
to reduce symptoms (although this was over a short, two-hour period and can’t be extrapolated longer-term).
Another way to find out about the health impact of cats is qualitative research: asking people what their cats mean to them, beyond the numbers.
When colleagues and I
surveyed veterans
, we found people more attached to their pets actually had poorer mental health scores. But their survey responses told a different story. One respondent said, “my cats are the reason I get up in the morning”.
Another wrote:
I consider my pet to be a service animal. My cat helps me to relax when I’m dealing with my anxiety, depression or when I wake during the night from the frequent nightmares I have. My cat isn’t just a pet to me, my cat is a part of me, my cat is part of my family.
It may be that veterans were more attached to their cats because they had worse mental health – and relied on their cats more for comfort – rather than the other way around.
Mental health downsides
It is possible being attached to your cat has downsides. If your cat becomes sick, the burden of caring for them may have a negative impact on your mental health.
In our study
of owners whose cats had epilepsy, around one third experienced a clinical level of burden as caregivers that was likely to interfere with their day-to-day functioning.
People with depression report reduced symptoms after playing with their cat.

Toxoplasmosis
Cats can also carry
zoonotic
diseases, which are infections which spread from animals to humans.
They are the main host for
toxoplasmosis
, a parasite excreted in cat faeces which can affect other mammals, including humans. The parasite is more likely to be carried by
feral cats
that hunt for their food than domestic cats.
Most people have
mild symptoms
that may be similar to flu. But
infection during pregnancy
can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth, or cause problems for the baby including blindness and seizures.
Pregnant women and people with lowered immunity are
most at risk
. It is recommended these groups don’t empty cat litter trays, or use gloves if they have to. Changing the litter tray daily prevents the parasite
reaching a stage
that could infect people.
Allergies
Up to one in five people have an
allergy to cats
and this is increasing.
When cats lick their fur, their saliva deposits an allergen. When their fur and
dander
(flakes of skin) come loose, it can set off an allergic reaction.
People without severe allergies can still live with cats if they regularly wash their hands, clean surfaces and vacuum to eliminate dander. They can also exclude cats from areas they want to be allergen-free, such as bedrooms.
People with allergies can live with cats if their symptoms aren’t severe.

While cats can provoke allergic reactions,
there is also evidence
contact with cats can have a protective role in preventing asthma and allergic reactions developing. This is because exposure may modify the immune system, making it less likely allergic reactions will occur."
Cat plague is back after nearly 40 years in hiding – here’s what you need to know,https://theconversation.com/cat-plague-is-back-after-nearly-40-years-in-hiding-heres-what-you-need-to-know-91234,"A deadly feline disease is now spreading between cats after hiding in nature for nearly 40 years. Multiple cases of feline parvovirus, also known as cat plague, or panleukopenia, have been reported in stray kittens in
the greater Melbourne area
this week.
Feline parvovirus was a common disease in the 1960s and 1970s. Australia was one of the first countries to develop an effective vaccine. Once widespread vaccination became routine, the disease was pushed back into nature.
Most cases of parvovirus are in kittens and young cats.
Raphael Schaller
In the 1970s, cases were typically seen in unvaccinated kittens purchased from markets or pet stores, and in shelters where vaccination protocols were lax.
Between the early 1980s and 2015, cases were unreported, but no doubt feral and semi-owned cats were still sporadically infected.
The re-emergence first occurred in animal shelters in
Mildura and Melbourne in 2016
and
south-western Sydney in 2016
. Many cats died. Even survivors suffered greatly. In all these outbreaks, affected cats had one thing in common – they had not been vaccinated.
What is feline parvovirus and how does it kill?
Feline parvovirus has a predilection for infecting rapidly dividing tissues. Cells lining the small intestine of infected cats are killed, resulting in vomiting, diarrhoea (often bloody), fever, lethargy, anorexia and sometimes sudden death.
The bone marrow is transiently wiped out by the virus, resulting in a depletion of white blood cells. As a result, infected cats are unable to fight the invasion by secondary bacteria that attack the leaky gut wall.

How desexing cats saves lives
Most cases of feline parvovirus are in unvaccinated kittens or young cats. The welfare of cats is hugely impacted by this terrible disease – it makes cats miserable for many days, if they survive.
Treatment involves intensive therapy in hospital: intravenous fluids by infusion pump, medication to reduce vomiting, expensive anti-viral treatment (omega-interferon), opioids for pain relief, antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, and occasionally blood or plasma transfusions and nutritional support (feeding tubes).
This eight-week-old kitten, Cola, wasn’t vaccinated and contracted feline parvovirus. She needed a transfusion and recovered from the infection.
David Hughes
Treatment can costs thousands of dollars, and many owners just can’t afford it. But even with treatment, the fatality rate remains high.
Feline parvovirus is spread by faeco-oral contamination: from infected cats shedding virus in their faeces. Litter trays and natural latrines (such as sandboxes) are prime sources of infection.
This may occur where infected cats are kept close to uninfected cats (in shelters and pounds), and in homes where cats have outdoor access. But you can track feline parvovirus into your house on your shoes or clothing, so even 100% indoor cats are not safe.
Feline parvovirus can usually be quickly diagnosed by veterinarians using rapid point-of-care test kits and then confirmed in a lab.
There is no risk of this virus spreading to human patients.
How did it re-emerge?
Feline parvovirus was never completely eliminated from the Australian cat population and instead has been maintained at low levels in the unowned and feral cat population for the past 40 years. Remember, there are perhaps six times as many unowned cats than owned cats in Australia!
This adaptable virus also has the potential to infect foxes and wild dogs, only later to be passed back to cats, providing a variety of potential environmental reservoirs.

Our dogs and cats are spreading fleas around the world (and to us)
Perhaps with an increased effort to rehabilitate and rehome “fringe dwelling cats”, it was inevitable that the virus would spill back from these unvaccinated cats into the general pet cat population, given waning herd immunity.
Consistent with this hypothesis is the first outbreak occurring in rural Mildura, a somewhat underprivileged socioeconomic area (
government figures show
the median household income is A$878 per week), and subject to incursions by feral cats, foxes and wild dogs – including dogs used for hunting.
Unvaccinated pet cats permitted the re-emergence of the virus.
David Vázquez
It is our suspicion that the cost of vaccinating the family cat (currently more than A$200 for a kitten requiring a course of two to three vaccines) exceeds the budget for many pet owners.
The best protection for any cat (and every cat) is widespread vaccination of as many cats as possible in the community at large. This “herd immunity” is the best protection against this highly contagious, persistent, resistant virus. When vaccination rates fall below 70%, cat populations are in trouble.
How do we protect pet cats?
Vaccination against feline parvovirus is highly effective (more than 99%) and is given by veterinarians as part of an
F3 or F4 vaccine
at the same time as a routine health check.
The Australian Veterinary Association recently recommended all cats be vaccinated annually. But with the modern range of vaccines, there is
good evidence that in kittens older than 16 weeks
, a single vaccination produces immunity which last several years
If a kitten has received two or three kitten vaccinations (the last one at 16-18 weeks of age), and a booster one year later, it likely has excellent protection against the virus, probably for several years, and possibly for life.
Is it time to vaccinate?
Krista Mangulsone
If your adult cat has received an annual vaccination in the past three years, it likely has excellent protection.
If your cat is more than three years overdue for its vaccination, it is sensible to visit your local veterinarian soon. Your cat will develop or maintain excellent protection within a few days of vaccination.
But what about unowned and feral cats?
We need to support efforts to vaccinate cats that have never been vaccinated against feline parvovirus – cats owned by people who are unable to afford vaccinations, and cats that have been dumped and are now unowned and free-roaming.
New South Wales is making some progress in this area. The NSW Cat Protection Society responded to a 2017 outbreak by
subsidising free vaccinations
for cat owners in Sydney. RSPCA NSW has ongoing
targeted low-cost vaccination programs
for cat owners, particularly in regional and remote areas of NSW.
Trap-neuter and return programs
, while controversial, usually involve administering a F3/F4 vaccination to unowned and feral cats, thereby boosting herd immunity against feline parvovirus and also possibly reducing cat numbers.

Cat lovers rejoice: watching online videos lowers stress and makes you happy
Finally, for people who cannot afford veterinary care because of their life circumstances,
Pets in the Park
and similar charities can provide another option for vaccination.
Remember, the larger the proportion of the cat population that is vaccinated, the less chance any cat and every cat has of becoming infected. Stated another way, it’s far more effective to maximise the proportion of the cat population that is vaccinated, rather than over-vaccinating only a limited proportion of cats."

Toys filled with the leaves or extracts of these plants can cause apparently euphoric behaviour in domestic cats (as well as big cats like leopards and jaguars). Not all cats respond this way to these smells, which is
believed to have a genetic basis
.
When cats encounter smelly treats, they might behave playfully, rubbing or rolling around.
Anne Quain
Are these treats safe for cats?
Cats have a highly developed sense of smell. Some plants release chemical compounds to deter insects or to attract predators of insects that might otherwise destroy them. This includes
nepetalactone
, an ingredient isolated from catnip and silver vine.
Indeed,
it has been argued
that exposure to nepetalactone leads to an increase in feel-good hormones in cats. It may also act as a
natural mosquito repellent
(note that it does not repel all mosquitoes and is not effective for flea or tick control).
This may be why sniffing catnip, silver vine and some other plants causes cats to roll on their backs and rub their chins, cheeks and bodies on the plants. Other
observed behaviours
include: licking, shaking their head while carrying plant material in their mouth, drooling, kicking the plant material with their hind feet, and a “wavelike” motion of the skin over their backs as muscles contract and relax.
These responses
generally don’t last long
, usually  seconds to minutes, before cats relax or resume their normal behaviour.
Rather than becoming addicted to these substances, cats are more likely to become habituated and desensitised, with the plants having less effect over time. When sniffed, these plants
appear
to have
no adverse effects
on cats.
Cats (and a dog!) react to the active compound in catnip and silver vine, nepetalactone.

What actually is catnip and is it safe for my cat?
Is it ethical to alter the minds of our cats?
When considering how to improve the lives of animals we care for, we tend to focus on whether the benefits outweigh the potential harms.
Despite some marketing claims that these plants activates the brain’s opioid system, delivering a “natural high” for cats, there is no evidence these substances actually alter the minds of cats in the same way as alcohol or other drugs alter the minds of humans.
The marketing of these cat treats as “kitty crack” or “
meowijuana
” and silver vine sticks as “
kitty cigarettes
” is likely to deter some people from offering their cats
this kind of olfactory stimulation
.
Unlike offering alcohol to a child, though, the evidence suggests our cats are OK when given access to these treats. These items won’t induce psychosis and won’t lead to addiction or withdrawal symptoms. And we don’t need to worry about our cats operating heavy machinery or making important decisions under the influence of mind-altering substances!
Provided they can walk away at any time, it seems reasonable to let them opt in to a fun time.
In fact, we harness the power of cats’ sense of smell in other ways by using
synthetic feline facial pheromones
. This can help reduce fear, anxiety and distress in cats. These substances can come in useful in settings such as multi-cat households or when moving house.

Is it unethical to give your cat catnip?
How to make sure your cat has the purr-fect time
Offering a range of smells (olfactory stimulation) is just one way to ensure your cat has a varied and interesting life. Here are some tips:
offer cats choices to interact with treats and toys – don’t force them
rotate the toys and experiences on offer, so every day offers something fresh
offer items that cats can scratch – scratching posts and corrugated cardboard are popular items
if you are concerned your cat has swallowed part of a toy or seems unwell, check in with your vet.
Given the short-lived effects of these plant-based olfactory stimulants on cats, it is important that we
optimise their environment, lifestyle and interactions
with humans to improve their welfare. We can’t just rely on catnip or silver vine to give our cats a good life indoors – it’s really up to us!"
How desexing cats saves lives,https://theconversation.com/how-desexing-cats-saves-lives-19914,"Thousands of unowned cats wander Australian streets every night. Some are feral, existing in self-sustaining populations not reliant on people, while others are semi-feral and are either fed by people or scavenge discarded food.
Those cats hunt native fauna and harbour disease and parasites that can be passed on to humans, pets and wildlife.
Yet depending on where you live in Australia, the rules on desexing and registering your cat can vary wildly. The result? Greater risks to human health, and tens of thousands of kittens and cats needlessly killed in animal shelters every year.
Pets and parasites
Many cats carry the parasite
Toxoplasma gondii
, which can be passed to humans through litter trays, soil and undercooked meat.
The risk is greatest for pregnant woman and people with compromised immune systems. An unborn foetus with Toxoplasmosis can suffer permanent neuorological damage or even miscarriage or stillbirth.
Research has shown
how we can reduce those risks to humans and unborn babies, including by educating cat owners about the importance of collecting cat faeces in litter boxes, desexing pet cats to reduce overpopulation and reducing the numbers of feral cats.
So there are clear benefits to human health of managing our cat population. But desexing is the kinder thing to do for cats too - not least because it avoids so many cats and kittens being put down.
Life on the streets
Many feral and semi-feral cats experience poor health and animal welfare outcomes because they are not owned or cared for like a pet cat.
Local councils and animal shelters have to
euthanase tens of thousands of cats
each year because they are in poor health, are behaviourally unsuited to adoption or homes cannot be found for them.
More than 30,000 impounded cats were put down
in NSW alone during 2010/11
.
Killing kittens
A high shelter admission rate of kittens by owners indicates that unwanted litters by pet cats are a significant contributor to the problem.
In Queensland, 6950 kittens were surrendered by owners to
animal shelters
, with kittens making up one-fifth of cats in the state’s shelters. And 61% of all kittens had to be euthanased because homes could not be found for them.
But we have no way to track how many unwanted kittens are also abandoned to join feral and semi-feral populations, on top of the unowned kittens born to feral or semi-feral cats mating with pet cats.
Desexing prevents unwanted litters
Mandatory desexing of pet cats from an early age would help prevent pet cats having unwanted litters, and the associated problems of surrender to animal shelters, abandonment or interbreeding with feral and semi-feral populations.
While desexing rates for pet cats in Australia are already above 90%, which is high by international standards, many cats are not desexed until later in life so they have opportunities to breed.
Cats may breed from four months old, so desexing of young kittens is needed to prevent breeding altogether. Given veterinary evidence that anaesthetic risks in young cats can be controlled and that adverse outcomes are no higher than for older cats, increasing numbers of cat rescue organisations are endorsing desexing of pre-pubescent kittens.
Australian laws on pet cats
Since 1 November this year, if you’re a West Australian cat owner,
it’s become mandatory
to desex, microchip and register any cats you have with a local council by the time the cat is six months old.
The only exceptions to mandatory desexing are cats owned by licensed breeders or cats certified by a veterinarian as having poor health risks for surgery. Pet cats must also wear an ID tag.
If the number of owner-admitted unwanted cats can be reduced through mandatory desexing, rehoming of other cats from shelters will increase, which should result in a lower euthanasia rate. The hidden problem of abandonment of unwanted kittens should also be reduced.
While desexing may seem like a logical step in reducing cat populations, WA and the
Australian Capital Territory
are the only parts of Australia where the practice is mandatory.
Registration and desexing are not mandatory in South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory or Queensland, although it may be a requirement of some local councils.
In contrast to what has happened in WA, the
Queensland government has recently repealed
state legislation for mandatory cat registration, arguing it’s a win for cat owners and for reducing
“red tape”
.

But in our opinion, Queensland is taking a backward step by joining with South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory in adopting such a hands-off approach.
In doing so, we are likely to see more unwanted kittens and cats born that will end up being put down in our shelters. And it risks increasing the problems of animal welfare, wildlife management and public health problems associated with large populations of semi-feral and feral cats.
Addressing these issues requires strong leadership from state and territory governments, commitment by local councils to enforce regulations, and responsible cat ownership in the community.
The health risks to humans, as well as the huge number of kittens being born only to be killed, are too high for this issue not to be taken more seriously."
Why are some cats more allergenic than others? It’s not their coat length,https://theconversation.com/why-are-some-cats-more-allergenic-than-others-its-not-their-coat-length-251133,"Allergies can be debilitating for those who have them – even more so when the cause of the allergic reaction is a beloved pet.
Second only to dust mites
, the humble domestic house cat is
one of the major causes
of indoor allergens for people.
But what is the actual source of
the allergic response
? And are certain breeds less allergenic than others? There are many myths and misconceptions related to cat allergens, so let’s debunk a few.
Cats produce several allergens, but Fel d 1 is the biggest culprit.
My Agency/Shutterstock
It’s not the hair!
Contrary to common misconception, cat hair is not the cause of allergies in people.
Rather, the allergy is down to a pesky protein commonly referred to as
Fel d 1
. This protein is produced in a cat’s saliva and skin glands. While cats produce at least eight allergens, it is Fel d 1 which
studies
have shown to be the leading cat allergen.
Fel d 1 is a microscopic protein that readily sticks to clothing and other surfaces. It can also remain airborne for long periods of time, making it easy to inhale.
Studies have shown
it can even be found in homes without cats, brought in from outside on clothes and other objects – not great news for people with a severe allergy.
The Fel d 1 allergen is transferred to the cat’s hair and skin when they groom themselves. It then spreads into their environment when they shed hair and
dander
, which is mostly comprised of dead skin cells.
Although the cat’s hair can carry the allergens, the hair itself is not at fault here. Even hairless Sphynx cats secrete the protein. This is also why longer haired, fluffier cats don’t necessarily make you more allergic.
Sphynx cats might not have much hair, but they still produce the allergen.
Erin Agius/Unsplash
It’s not the breed, either
In fact, research has shown that neither
the length of the cat’s hair
, nor
the colour
of its coat, appear to have any significant bearing on how much allergen the cat produces.
Regardless of a cat’s breed,
sex
and
individual variation
in the production of Fel d 1 are the main reason why some cats seem to cause a greater allergic response than others.
It has long been known that on average, unneutered male cats produce more Fel d 1
than females or neutered males
.
Some studies
have also found that older cats tend to produce lower levels of Fel d 1 than younger cats.
While there are breeds referred to as “
hypoallergenic
”, it is important to remember this does not mean “allergen-free”. According to a review
published in 2024
, “to date, there is no scientific evidence for a hypoallergenic cat breed”.
However, putting our strict hypoallergenic definition aside, a few small studies have reported reduced levels of Fel d 1 production in
some of these breeds
. It is important to remember though that even in individual cats, production of Fel d 1 can
vary widely throughout the year
.
Further studies in these breeds, using larger sample sizes, is needed to confirm these findings.
Overall, the fact that sensitive people report an increased allergic response to some cats rather than others is likely due to variation in how much Fel d 1 the individual cat produces.
Just because a cat is fluffy, doesn’t mean it’s going to set your allergies off more.
Ricardo L/Unsplash
Can we make cats less allergenic?
In the last few years, several studies have investigated the possibility of
vaccinating cats against the Fel d 1 protein
.
While this would be great news for allergy sufferers, the issue is that researchers are currently unsure what role the protein plays in cats. Current evidence suggests it may play a role in the dispersal of pheromones, and potentially in protecting the cat’s skin; further research is needed.
There is also
some initial evidence
to suggest that therapeutic diets in which an antibody is added from chicken eggs (IgY antibodies) can reduce the production of Fel d 1 that a cat produces. However, larger studies are needed before we might start seeing “anti-allergy” cat food on the shelves.
There is some evidence to suggest that exposure to cats at a young age may reduce the likelihood of a person developing an allergy.
If you’re an adult allergic to cats but still would like to have one,
there is good evidence
to suggest regular cleaning can substantially decrease the amount of cat allergens in your home.
Even though the jury is out on the scientific evidence for “hypoallergenic” cat breeds, some cats really are less allergenic than others.
Despite the challenges for those that are allergic, you are not doomed to have to avoid cats for the rest of your life. With the right management and care, cat ownership is entirely possible – and absolutely worth it."
Herding cats: councils’ efforts to protect wildlife from roaming pets are hampered by state laws,https://theconversation.com/herding-cats-councils-efforts-to-protect-wildlife-from-roaming-pets-are-hampered-by-state-laws-200266,"How we manage pet cats in our suburbs is
in the spotlight
.  As the estimated number of pet cats in Australia
passes 5 million
, people are increasingly aware of the damage cats do to wildlife.
One-third of owners
already keep their cats securely contained 24 hours a day. This has major
benefits for cat welfare
and prevents cats killing and disturbing wildlife. But that leaves the other 3.5 million or so pet cats free to roam for at least part of the day or night.
In Australia, local government is responsible for regulating our feline pets, but little is known about how this works in practice. We sent a survey to every local council in Australia to understand their approaches to managing pet cats and how these could be improved. We received responses from 240 councils (45%).
Councils across Australia reported managing pet cats is a challenge. But many are adopting regulations that to help protect local wildlife and improve the wellbeing of pet cats. However, state laws, especially in Western Australia and New South Wales, are making it difficult for local councils to manage pet cats well.

Cats kill more than their owners realise
Why the big deal? Many cat owners think their moggy is blameless. “I don’t think my cat goes out that much and I never see any dead animals,” they often say. This is largely untrue.
Research shows the impact of pet cats is much bigger than people realise. Many cats don’t bring home what they kill, or bring back only a very small proportion (
15% on average
), so their owners aren’t aware of the majority of the wildlife toll. Radio-tracking studies have shown a
large proportion
of cats are out on adventures when their owners thought they were inside.
On average,
each roaming, hunting pet cat
in Australia kills 40 native reptiles, 38 native birds and 32 native mammals per year.

Our suburbs are now home to around
55 cats per square kilometre
. That adds up to about 6,000 native animals killed per square kilometre per year in our suburbs alone. The national wildlife death toll from pet cats is well
over 300 million native animals
per year.
Even when roaming cats don’t kill animals, they have negative impacts on wildlife by
spreading diseases
and because wildlife must spend more time hiding or escaping
instead of feeding and caring
for young.

As well as hunting wildlife, roaming pet cats can increase feral cat populations  if unwanted litters are abandoned.
Seeing wildlife, like blue-tongued lizards and fairywrens, in our gardens and local parks is something we all cherish. How we manage pet cats can either jeopardise our co-existing wildlife or help to safeguard it. So we set out to examine how pet cats are being managed across the country.
It can be hard for small birds that stay close to the ground, like this fairywren, to persist in areas with roaming cats.

What are councils doing about it?
Our
survey
found almost all local councils require pet cats to be microchipped. Three-quarters require them to be registered. Just over half require desexing and limit the number of cats that can be kept per household.
These approaches are very important to manage pet cats and constrain their numbers  and should be extended to all local government areas. However, these measures do not prevent pet cats roaming.
Concern about the impacts of roaming cats has led almost one-third of councils to introduce cat-free areas, cat curfews and containment requirements at all or some places in their local government area. Where adequately policed, these measures appear to be working.
The percentages of local councils that use each of the cat management actions.

These approaches are most common in city areas of the ACT, Victoria and South Australia, and on some islands. The number of local government areas using this approach has grown markedly over the past five years, partly in response to growing awareness of the impacts of pet cats on wildlife.
For example, Adelaide Hills Council (SA) and Victoria’s Knox City Council brought in 24-hour containment last year. There are plans to do the same on Phillip Island (Victoria) later this year. Bruny Island (Tasmania) and Kangaroo Island (SA) both require cats to be contained. In NSW, Tweed Shire has designated some recently built and future suburbs, which are next to bushland with high conservation value, as cat-free.
Christmas Island has gone further. All pet cats are desexed and the community has agreed not to bring in any more, so their numbers on the island are gradually dwindling.

Why do our dogs and cats bring us dead animals?
Some state laws stand in the way of better protection
Many local councils would also like to adopt containment regulations and no-cat areas as part of strategies to protect local wildlife. However, the overarching laws on domestic animal management are set at the state level. If these laws don’t allow local government to set and then police cat containment bylaws, then the local councils can be hamstrung.
State and territory laws regarding pets are highly variable and can either help or hinder local councils’ efforts to enact and enforce cat restriction bylaws.
Elizabeth Lindsay/Threatened Species Recovery Hub
Local councils in WA and NSW complained most often about this situation. They want changes to state laws to make it easier for them to set and police local rules about cat containment or cat prohibition.
In SA, local governments noted inconsistencies in cat containment provisions between councils make implementation and enforcement challenging. A statewide approach using the SA Dog and Cat Management Act would be more effective.
To support fair and effective management of pet cats we recommend all states and territories adopt strong and nationally consistent legislation to enable responsible pet cat management.
This should be supported by enhanced community awareness programs and support for owners and their pets to make the transition to a new, contained lifestyle. Outcomes for local wildlife and for cat welfare and health should also be monitored.
Protecting wildlife and caring for our delightful pets can both be achieved if we rethink
what it is to be a cat owner
and support local government to manage these issues for the whole community."
Are your cats fighting or playing? Scientists analysed cat videos to figure out the difference,https://theconversation.com/are-your-cats-fighting-or-playing-scientists-analysed-cat-videos-to-figure-out-the-difference-198501,"Have you ever worried if the play between your cats was getting too rough? A new study
published in Scientific Reports
has investigated play and fighting in cats.
Their aim was to use simple behaviours anyone could observe to work out what was play and what might lead to fights. This is important because the
consequences of fights include injuries to animals and humans
. At worst, you may even have to rehome one of your cats if they’re not getting along.
Categorising cat ‘fights’
The study, led by
Noema Gajdoš-Kmecová
from University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy in Slovakia and from the University of Lincoln, UK, analysed 105 videos of interactions between 210 cats.
The research team then
developed an ethogram
– a list of specific behaviours used in the study of animal behaviour. These were put into six groups:
Inactive: head and body motionless and in specific position, for example crouching
Wrestling: cats in physical contact with wrestling movements
Chasing: one cat runs in pursuit or another cat runs away
Other interactive activities: for example grooming, approaching, raised fur on back
Non-interactive: activity directed towards themselves or an inanimate object, for example drinking, self-licking
Vocalisation: for example growl, hiss, meow
The researchers used terms such as “cats play fighting” to find relevant videos on YouTube.
Each video was analysed to identify which of these behaviours were shown by each cat. Each interaction was then analysed statistically to work out which behaviours
appeared together in clusters
.
From this, the researchers separated the videos into three categories of interactions.
Playful
: included 40% of cats from the videos and included wrestling and a lack of vocalising.
Agonistic
:
agonistic behaviours
are any social behaviours that include threatening, aggression and submission. Cats in this group vocalised and had recurring bouts of inactivity; 32% of cats from the sample landed in this group.
Intermediate
: this group included 28% of cats and was more closely associated with the playful group than the agonistic group. Cats in this group interacted for prolonged periods with pauses in between.
As a crosscheck, these behavioural categories observed from the videos agreed fairly well with how the four authors, experts in cat behaviour, described each interaction.
Despite being quite territorial, some cats can happily share a home with others of their feline kind.
Smile19/Shutterstock
What does this tell you about your cats’ play?
If your cats are wrestling, they are most likely playing. When there is friction between cats in a multi-cat household, they tend to avoid physical contact. Instead, they’ll use offensive or defensive manoeuvres that don’t involve extended direct contact, such as slapping.
If your cats are vocalising, and chasing between periods of inactivity (such as crouching) they are most likely fighting. Vocalisation is an especially important clue here to an aggressive, rather than playful interaction. Chasing is OK if it’s mutual, but if one cat is chasing or one cat is running away, that’s not so positive.
The intermediate group is the tricky one. It contains elements of both playful and agonistic behaviours, though was more closely related to the playful than the agonistic group. This suggests play could
become
agonistic, depending on what happens during the interaction.
In particular, the authors observed frequent breaks within the interaction, which may allow cats to reassess their partner’s interest in playing, and avoid escalation from play to aggression.
The big fights are easy to spot
This study is the first to apply a scientific approach to cat behaviours anybody can identify, describing three types of interactions to help identify between play and fighting in cats.
We all know when cats are
really
fighting, but the main strength is in working out intermediate examples – where it could be OK, but could also escalate.
The study focused on obvious behaviours anybody can observe, but cats can be quite subtle, too. They also use facial expression, ear and tail placement, and pheromones to communicate. These subtle signals may be just as important in differentiating between what is playing and what is fighting.
Not all cat communication is obvious to us humans – they tend to use their ears, faces, and even pheromones to signal to each other.
Gurkan Ergun/Shutterstock
If your cats really are besties (sleep in close contact and share food and toys)  the occasional bit of agonistic play is okay.
But if your cats don’t get on as well, you might need to watch for signs of agonistic behaviours. Tension between cats is not always obvious, but can affect their physical and mental health.
If you are unsure if your cats are really getting along, seeking help early from an expert in cat behaviour can prevent a cat-astrophe."
How to tell when cats are fighting or just playing: six important clues to watch out for,https://theconversation.com/how-to-tell-when-cats-are-fighting-or-just-playing-six-important-clues-to-watch-out-for-198692,"Cats and dogs famously don’t get on with each other. We seem quite able to recognise a fight between these two species. However, even experienced cat owners can struggle to tell the difference between rough-and-tumble play and scraps between cats. Some people may tell themselves it doesn’t matter and cats just do what they want. But knowing when to intervene is important for a cat’s welfare.
A recent paper
published in Scientific Reports
studied how to differentiate between cat-to-cat interactions, including when play escalates to aggression. The study, which analysed videos of cats socialising, found owners can help their pets’ welfare by monitoring their cats and intervening when aggression starts. Another finding was that cats can have short-term disagreements, not unlike the way humans have squabbles with their friends.
But to be a good peacemaker and stop a genuine conflict, you need to understand the evolutionary history of our companion cats’ social lives and interpret their body language.
Cats are originally a
solitary species
. For the domestic cat, living with us can often mean living close together with other cats. A
recent study
found that a little over one in two cats (55% of the cats from 5,129 respondents living mainly in the UK, but also other European countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA) live in a so-called “multi-cat” household.
Domestic cats are
more flexible
than their ancestors. They’ve evolved to become
a semi-social species
. But
not all cats can tolerate
sharing their home with another cat, which may
stress them out
.
Heredity factors
as well as early life circumstances will affect a cat’s ability to live with another cat. Often same-sex combinations
find it easier to share
their living space, particularly two females with familial ties.
When cats live together, they may merely share the same home or they may bond. One sign cats enjoy one another’s company is if they sleep together with their bodies and heads directed towards each other.
Not all cats can get along like this pair.
VasiLyeva.Anna/Shutterstock
But cats may also value a certain spot for warmth, a view, or the company of their human which may make them choose to lie close together. At the same time they may show signs they are too close for comfort, for example they may face away from each other, or one cat may stare the other down. Such cats are also less likely to play together.
Kittens romp with each other and play with objects by themselves. The
peak of social play
is between the ninth and 14th week of a kitten’s life. Kittens that live with their litter mates for longer
may become more practiced
at the social skills involved in play. Play is crucial for a kitten’s development. It’s indispensable for cats who will share territory with
other cats later in life
.
Getting enough playtime is serious for kittens’ development.

How
do you recognise actual, true, play
in kittens and cats? Actual play can be recognised by:
1) A
balance and equality in the play
(reciprocity), for instance switching positions when wrestling and chasing.
2) An inclination for the cats involved to move towards each other (their bodies will be directed towards each other for most of the time) in relaxed and exaggerated ways.
3) They aren’t
hissing, growling or spitting at each other
.
4) Neither cats’ ears are pinned back.
5) When they raise their paws towards another cat, they keep their claws sheathed.
6) When they bite each other it can be part of the play, but it will be inhibited – so their teeth won’t actually dent the other’s skin (or worse).
These cats don’t look like they’ve taken things too far - yet.
Magui RF/Shutterstock
Cats are nuanced, complicated creatures and so is their play. They may also engage in play fighting –
a mixture of play and fighting
, which may be more difficult to recognise. This kind of interaction can
harm the social bond between the cats
.
Whenever you hear vocalisations such as growling or hissing, see enlarged pupils, prolonged staring (with hard eyes or tense bodies),
the use of claws and teeth
(recognisable by hairs coming loose), you need to divert the cats’ attention in a calm way to stop the interaction. For instance by making a soft sound or by offering a toy at a short distance from the cats.
If you find little scabs – wound crusts can be a mere speck – it’s a sign cats were not playing, but fighting.
Remember to make time to play with your cat.
SunRay BRI Cattery RU/Shutterstock
Social play can be an enrichment for cats, but only if it is balanced and pleasurable for all cats involved. If one cat becomes an object of play, for instance by being chased when it does not want to be chased, don’t laugh it off as “just playing”. Instead, look at alternative ways for all cats to feel safe.
Creating hiding nooks and high places gives somewhere for a cat that does not want to be chased to escape. Cats can play on their own. But even in single-cat households, play is a great way for owners to
strengthen their connection
with their cat."
How to cut stray cat numbers in a way that works better for everyone,https://theconversation.com/how-to-cut-stray-cat-numbers-in-a-way-that-works-better-for-everyone-229291,"Stray cats are a big problem across most Australian cities and towns. They cause many complaints related to nuisance behaviours and concerns about urban wildlife, as well as straining government resources. Ratepayers ultimately pay for the substantial costs created by roaming cats.
Mandatory registration, desexing, microchipping and containment of cats on owners’ properties have had limited effect. We see owned cats and strays roaming across most urban areas. Most strays
are in disadvantaged suburbs
, where
compassionate residents
(considered semi-owners) feed and care for them.
Discussions about cat overpopulation tend to focus on the cats themselves and the challenges they bring. The limitations of current management strategies to control cat numbers, such as local government trapping programs, are neglected.
Councils keep covering the costs of cat management without asking “why are current practices not working?” or “are we in line with our social licence to operate?” In other words, is there broad support for euthanising huge numbers of cats?
An estimated
50,000 are killed
each year. This has
devastating effects
on the mental health of
many animal management staff
.
It’s imperative to shift the focus to adopting more effective management methods. The solution is a no-barrier, community cat desexing program. This also requires a shift in mindset so animal management officers give priority to community assistance over enforcement.
Our
new research
reveals the remarkable results of one such program, entirely funded by one local council. Over eight years, cat intakes fell to a third of what they were and euthanasia to less than a fifth. Cat-related complaints fell too. These outcomes saved the council nearly half-a-million dollars over the eight years.
Tackling a complex problem
Cat overpopulation is a complex issue with far-reaching social implications.
Council practices can create extra problems,
particularly for communities
where residents struggle to comply with curfews, can’t afford to pay for desexing, or lack transport to get to the vet. Individuals are left feeling overwhelmed and unable to care adequately for their pets.
Council officers spend a lot of time dealing with the repercussions. This work includes trapping and impounding cats. Knowing the likely outcome will be euthanasia
harms their mental health
.
So, not only is there a lack of support for cat owners and semi-owners, but the mental wellbeing of people in animal care roles is neglected. They include animal management officers, shelter workers, rescue groups and veterinarians who must euthanise healthy animals.
The stark reality is owners reclaim only about
7% of cats
taken to pounds and shelters in Australia. That leaves the challenging options of adoption or euthanasia for most of the cats.
Across Australia,
one-third of cats and kittens

How one council found a better way
Banyule City Council in Victoria ran a council-funded, no-barriers and targeted community cat desexing program from 2013. Our study reports on the results after eight years.
Cat desexing, microchipping and registration were free in the first year. There were no limits on the number of cats from each household. Free desexing is still offered.
To ensure everyone had access, the program provided free transport to these services. It encouraged semi-owners, who regularly fed stray cats, to take part and make the transition to official cat ownership.
The program also targeted disadvantaged suburbs. These areas were identified as hotspots for cat-related complaints and impoundments.
Two Banyule animal management officers implemented this program. They believed there was a better way to manage cats in their community – and they were right.
Over the eight years, large falls in impoundments (66%), euthanasia (82%) and cat-related calls (36%) were recorded across Banyule. In the three target suburbs, an average 4.1 cats a year per 1,000 residents were desexed.
Desexing costs totalled A$77,490. The council saved an estimated $440,660. This was largely due to reduced charges by Banyule’s contracted service for accepting cats, and savings for officers’ time because of fewer complaints.
Supporting residents to make it as easy as possible to get their cats sterilised has paid off for Banyule, in Victoria.

A program built on earning public trust
Winning the trust
of cat owners and carers is imperative. At first, people were hesitant and suspicious of Banyule’s animal management officers. This was mainly due to their perceived role of enforcement, such as issuing fines, rather than helping the community.
For the first year, many people worried about potential repercussions for owning or feeding more than the legally permitted two cats per property. Residents were reluctant to disclose the actual number of cats they owned or cared for. Some households harboured four or five cats, sometimes more, but concealed their presence at first.
Controlling cat numbers becomes a daunting task when the true extent of the problem remains uncertain. Without desexing all cats on a property, the program’s success will be limited.
The study findings highlight the importance of local councils and communities working together to manage urban cat populations. It’s equally important to minimise barriers to sterilisation and microchipping, and to target areas with the highest rates of cat-related issues and cats impounded.
Cat management is a community problem. It can only be solved by involving everyone who’s affected. Leveraging community centres, local social workers and support services, and other relevant agencies for referrals to the council is imperative.
Understanding each community and its unique needs depends on actively engaging with residents. This means walking the streets and talking with residents in a relatable manner, not as an authority figure. It’s essential to provide assistance, guidance and educational resources to support this approach.
This supportive approach is aligned with the
One Welfare
philosophy based on evidence that the wellbeing of animals, people and their environments are connected. The targeted free desexing program achieved better outcomes for people, animals, the council and the environment than a traditional compliance-based approach."
"TikTok says orange cats are ‘dumb’, and tortoiseshell cats have ‘an attitude’. But how true is that?",https://theconversation.com/tiktok-says-orange-cats-are-dumb-and-tortoiseshell-cats-have-an-attitude-but-how-true-is-that-218033,"If you’ve watched cat videos on social media lately, you may have encountered the idea a
cat’s coat colour
tells us something about their personality.
Orange cats are supposedly “dumb”, always
falling off beds
or getting themselves stuck in awkward places. Tortoiseshell cats are often said to have a strong-willed attitude (sometimes referred to as “
tortitude
”).
Black
cats are “smarter”, if social media is to be believed.
The idea a cat’s personality is linked to their coat colour isn’t new.
In 2012
a study of human perceptions of cats reported people generally believe ginger cats are friendly, while tortoiseshell cats are seen as aloof and intolerant.
It’s important to note this is a reflection people
believe
, rather than how cats
are
. So what does the research actually say?
Humans tend to ascribe certain meanings to particular behavioural traits in cats.

Surveys on cat personality are filled out by people
Research suggests that cats, like people, have different personality types. One study proposed the
“feline five”
personality traits for cats: neuroticism, extraversion, dominance, impulsiveness and agreeableness.
The researchers linked “neuroticism” in cats with being anxious, insecure, fearful of people and tense. Cats low in neuroticism were associated with being stable, trusting, calm and self-assured.
Cats categorised as impulsive scored highly for being erratic, reckless and distractible, while those low in impulsivity were considered to be predictable and constrained.
You might get a sense from these studies that these are not terms cats would choose for themselves, and you’d be right.
Surveys on cat personality are filled out by people. As such, results are affected by human perspectives, projections and biases.
Indeed, a review of methods used to define
personality in cats
concluded studies reporting differences in personality due to coat colour were likely to be affected by owner bias.

Breed personality
Instead of colour, it’s possible breed is more important when it comes to cat personality.
One
study
found British Shorthair cats were least likely to seek human contact, while Korat and Devon Rex cats were most likely.
Another study, however, found
substantial variation exists within breeds
, suggesting a cat’s breed may not fully explain personality.
Both of these studies were once again survey-based and so, again, human bias is likely affecting the results.
If it’s not coat or breed, what else is it?
Genetics is not the only factor influencing personality. The environment and how an animal is raised also has a big effect.
If kittens are not socialised with people by the age of
around nine weeks
, they are more likely to be anxious and shy around humans and other animals.
Whether your cat was hand-reared, purchased from a breeder or found in a box, they will likely behave differently depending on time spent with their mother.
In reality, humans tend to ascribe certain meanings to particular behavioural traits.
For instance, if a cat is fearful, they may come across as lacking intelligence because they are less likely to interact with their environment in ways we recognise as “smart”.
On the flip side, confident cats comfortable in their environment may seem “dumb”, as they act in a carefree way that registers as “stupid” to the human eye.
A cat that is bold and confident may look ‘dumb’ to humans.

Don’t judge a book by its cover – or a cat by it’s colour
While funny social media videos linking personality with cat coat colour might be harmless, the biases they create can have more harmful results. For instance, black cats take longer to adopt
from a shelter
than cats of other colours, and so are at higher risk of being euthanised.
Black animals are more difficult to photograph, meaning they may not look as attractive in adoption photos. Some people also believe black cats symbolise bad luck, or are associated with witchcraft or evil. Stereotypes of black cats being less friendly may also stem from facial expressions on darker fur being harder to read.
Before you dismiss this as speculation,
a study
did confirm human bias against black cats using photos of cats of different colours.
We shouldn’t be surprised people make judgements about cats based on their coat colour. We also make judgements based on human hair colour – take the baseless “dumb blonde” and “fiery redhead”
stereotypes
, for example.
And just like with human stereotypes, putting our cats into arbitrary boxes isn’t useful for anyone.
Instead, it’s best to think of your cat, and any cat, as the individuals they are.
Cats are much more than their coats. People and cats

close emotional bonds

"Can cats drink milk? Despite the stereotypes, it’s actually a bad idea",https://theconversation.com/can-cats-drink-milk-despite-the-stereotypes-its-actually-a-bad-idea-255227,"Cats have a
long history with humans
, going back more than 9,000 years. Attracted to human settlements by the rodents that plagued (sometimes literally) our ancestors, cats ingratiated themselves as useful mousers and slowly
domesticated themselves
.
Farmers began to employ them as
pest controllers
. It was through this arrangement that cats and milk first became acquainted.
Before the commercialisation of pet food, cats were mostly fed scraps from the family table. Not much was known about their nutritional needs. In his 1877 book on cats, Scottish doctor Gordon Stables insisted cats need two bowls – “
one for water and the other for milk
” – and suggested porridge and milk as an excellent feline breakfast.
From these origins, cats and milk became further embedded in the collective zeitgeist through depictions of milk-loving cats in art, books, movies and cartoons. There’s even the classic trope of the scruffy street cat being rescued from the rain to enjoy a saucer of milk from a kindly stranger.
While it’s not surprising that cats and milk have persisted as an unquestioned combination, research now tells us cats shouldn’t be drinking milk at all.
The cultural connection between cats and milk goes far back in history, as shown in this 1921 photo.

The vast majority of cats are lactose intolerant
Like all mammals, cats begin life drinking milk from their mother. But past kittenhood, milk is a completely unnecessary part of a cat’s diet.
After weaning (around 6–12 weeks of age), kittens stop producing the enzyme
lactase
, required to digest lactose in milk. For the vast majority of cats, this means they are
lactose intolerant
.
However, just like in humans, the level of intolerance varies for each individual based on how much of the enzyme their body naturally produces.
Don’t rush to give your kitten milk, though. Just because kittens can digest lactose doesn’t mean they should be drinking cow’s milk. Cats are much smaller animals than cows and, fittingly, the amount of lactose in
the milk of mother cats
is much lower than in cow’s milk. It’s best to let them drink from their mother or to get them a kitten-appropriate cat formula.
Lactose intolerance isn’t the only reason not to give your cats milk. Though rare,
cats can also develop an allergy
to milk or dairy.
Milk from mother cats is different to cow’s milk, which is not appropriate for kittens to drink.

What happens to cats who drink milk?
Lactose is a type of sugar. When it can’t be broken down to be absorbed into the bloodstream, lactose travels through the intestines to the colon where the
bacteria inside the body ferment it
.
This fermentation breaks lactose down into acids and gases which cause unpleasant symptoms, including the passing of excessive gas, bloating, constipation, abdominal pain and occasionally nausea and vomiting. In cats, the most common symptom observed is diarrhoea.
Chronic or persistent
diarrhoea
can cause further complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and malnutrition. In some cases, it can even be
life threatening
.
Cats who consume milk or dairy regularly as part of their diet are at increased risk of these health complications.
When farm mousers are ‘paid’ in milk, their lactose intolerance can cause diarrhoea and even serious health complications.
Aleksandr Lupin/Shutterstock
If milk is so bad for cats, why do they love it?
We often
like things that are bad for us
. But to answer this question, we first have to remember cow’s milk is intended for feeding and growing a baby cow.
To achieve this feat, it contains an assortment of proteins and fats that are highly palatable, especially to cats. Cats need high levels of protein and fat for optimal health and daily functioning.
Cow’s milk, in particular, is also high in
casein
, a protein that is broken down by the body into
alpha-casozepine
. In some studies, it’s been associated with a
calming
effect in cats. While this wouldn’t initially make a cat want to drink milk, it may create a comforting association with milk over time.
If you want to treat your cat, give them species appropriate foods, not cow’s milk or food meant for humans.

Can I give milk sometimes as a treat? What about milk alternatives?
The short answer is: no.
Dairy is not a natural part of cats’ diet. While they may like the taste, milk is likely to cause your furry friend discomfort and health issues, so it’s best to avoid entirely.
And if you’re thinking your cat is one of the lucky few that isn’t lactose intolerant, think again. Cats are very good at
hiding discomfort
because, in the wild, showing weakness would make them a target for predators.
If you absolutely must, opt for lactose-free milk or milk formulated specifically for cats, and keep it as a very occasional treat.
While it won’t upset their stomachs in the same way as regular cow’s milk, it still won’t offer your cat any nutritional benefit.
As for milk alternatives like oat, soy or almond milk? Any unusual additions to your cat’s diet are likely to cause digestive upset, so it’s best to avoid these as well.
The bottom line? Don’t give your cat milk. They don’t need it, they probably can’t digest it and it’s likely to cause more pain than it’s worth."
Is it really safe to feed your cat a vegan diet?,https://theconversation.com/is-it-really-safe-to-feed-your-cat-a-vegan-diet-213356,"Research Checks
interrogate newly published studies and how they’re reported in the media. The analysis is undertaken by one or more academics not involved with the study, and reviewed by another, to make sure it’s accurate.
Recently there’s been a trend of people wanting to feed their pets a diet that follows their own dietary preferences – which often means a meat-free diet.
Vets have long maintained that feeding cats a meat-free diet is a big no-no. But a new
study published
in the open-access journal PLOS ONE challenges this assumption. The researchers write in the abstract:
[…] cats fed vegan diets tended to be healthier than cats fed meat-based diets. This trend was clear and consistent. These results largely concur with previous, similar studies.
So, are vegan diets really more healthy for cats? When we start to pick apart the findings, we see the evidence is far from conclusive.
What the study involved
The authors of the study surveyed 1,369 cat owners, who fed their cats either a vegan or meat-based diet, about their cats’ health. Respondents were mostly female (91%) and represented a range of ages. Most lived in the UK, with others residing in Europe, North America or Oceania.
Most (about 65%) had themselves adopted some form of diet to reduce meat consumption – being either vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian (fish only), or reducing their meat consumption. A small portion (9%) fed their cats a vegan diet in spite of their own dietary choices.
The owners were asked about their cat’s health, including specific health conditions, medication use and how often they saw a vet. They were also asked their opinion on how healthy their cat was, and what they believed their vet would say about their cat’s health.
What did the study find?
Overall, the study found no evidence of detrimental health effects in cats fed a vegan diet. In fact, the authors suggest a vegan diet actually leads to health benefits for cats.
The researchers looked at seven indicators of illness and found non-significant reductions in all of them in cats on a vegan diet. These included reduced veterinary visits, reduced use of medications and fewer instances of owners thinking their cats were in poor health.
Non-significance means the researchers didn’t find
strong enough
evidence to say there was a meaningful difference between the groups – but it doesn’t mean there was no effect (especially since some of the trends were strong).
They found 15 diseases were more common in cats fed meat, while only seven diseases were more common in cats on a vegan diet. Examples of less common diseases for cats on a vegan diet included dental disease, skin disease and hormonal diseases. But again, the differences between the two diet groups were not statistically significant.
There was only one disease for which a significant statistical difference was observed: cats fed a vegan diet were slightly more likely to have kidney disease.
Putting the findings in context
Compared to similar past studies, this study included a relatively large number of cats. That said, only 127 of these cats were on a vegan diet.
Most of the health benefits reported for this group also did not reach statistical significance, which may be the result of simply not having enough animals in the study.
The authors reported a tendency towards positive effects of vegan diets. This means there was a general trend (which was sometimes strong), but doesn’t necessarily mean there is a very predictable relationship.
As a survey study, it’s not possible to confirm exactly what the cats were eating. Many of them went outside and may have
hunted down meaty treats
even while on a vegan diet. Some owners also fed their cats treats and essential nutrient supplements, so any beneficial effects (or a lack of harmful effects) may not be due to diet alone.
Another missing piece of information is how long the cats were kept on the diet. We might assume one year – but this isn’t specifically stated. This is important information since deficiency diseases can take time to develop.
The cats in the study may have gone out hunting for meaty treats without their owners’ knowledge.

Finally, any study assessing animal health will have inherent limitations if it’s designed as a survey. Pet owners usually aren’t medically trained and their “opinions” can be subjective and therefore biased.
Owners who had removed or reduced meat in their own diet were over-represented in the study. These people may already anticipate vegan diets are better for health, and this thinking could influence their responses.
It’s also worth noting the study was funded by ProVeg International – a food awareness organisation that promotes plant-based products. While this might not have impacted the validity of data, it could have influenced the stance taken when reporting on the results.

So, is a vegan diet good for my cat?
Only a handful of studies
have looked at health outcomes in cats fed vegan diets. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that, contrary to long-held beliefs, it
may
be possible for cats to stay healthy on a vegan diet.
However, we’ll need much more research before we can conclude vegan diets are better for cat health than diets containing meat.

Are vegan pet diets as unhealthy as they're claimed to be? Here's what the evidence says
To obtain really strong evidence on the safety and health benefits of vegan diets, we’d need clinical trials involving a large cat population and direct measurements of health through veterinary exams and lab tests.
One challenge that isn’t really addressed in this paper is how a vegan cat diet should be safely put together. We know plant-based diets typically lack a range of nutrients cats need and which their bodies can’t make.
Previous
studies
have shown cats on vegan diets to have severe deficiency disorders affecting the muscles.
It may be possible for owners to provide these nutrients through supplements, but this would require an understanding of cat nutrition, or some sound advice from an animal health professional. For most of us, achieving a well-balanced diet for our felines in this way will be tricky. And let’s not forget cats are natural hunters  and may well
like
the taste of meat!
It’s probably wise to wait before letting Felix go completely meat-free. If you feel very strongly about not feeding your cat meat, make sure to choose a commercial vegan pet diet and ask your vet about proper nutrient supplementation.
Blind peer review
This article is a fair analysis of the study. It importantly clarifies the study can’t conclude that it is safe or beneficial to feed a solely vegan diet to cats in the long term.
The details of the diets fed to these cats were very vague; cats on a predominately vegan diet may have been receiving non-vegan foods as well, which could have provided essential nutrients, such as taurine, that may have been deficient in fully vegan diets. It also gave no detail about wet versus dry diets, which is another dietary factor that can impact health.
As a feline specialist veterinarian, I know too well how good cats are at hiding signs of illness until they are very advanced; owner-reported health status simply isn’t good enough to determine a cat’s health.
For example, one concern with vegan diets is a lack of taurine, which is essential for cats. Taurine deficiency can cause retinal degeneration and cardiac disease, both of which would not be evident to owners until the conditions were very advanced. Nutrient deficiencies can take a long time to develop and the study didn’t report on long-term feeding of a solely vegan diet.
I also disagree that fewer vet visits and less medication indicate better health. The authors point out that part of the study was performed during COVID lockdowns, which we know had significant effects on veterinary visits and also on some health conditions.
To assess health impacts of vegan diets, much longer-term studies would be needed with more complete health assessments including examination of the back of the eye, blood tests and ultrasound examination.

Could the mystery of the meow be solved by a new talking cat collar?,https://theconversation.com/could-the-mystery-of-the-meow-be-solved-by-a-new-talking-cat-collar-58692,"Imagine you’re a cat, and, every time you meowed, the loud voice of a snooty-sounding British gentleman kindly informed your human guardian of your every thought and feeling (well, the thoughts and feelings you had
before
you were terrified by the sound of the voice).
A new product called
the Catterbox
– the world’s first talking cat collar – purports to do just that, using Bluetooth technology, a microphone and a speaker to capture a cat’s meow and translate it into an English-speaking human voice.
An ad for the Catterbox, which claims to be the world’s first ‘talking’ cat collar.
It’s not a joke; nor is it the first time a company has tried to use technology to translate cat meows for humans. A few years ago, the
Meowlingual
promised to interpret feline vocalization and expressions, but it didn’t exactly fly off the shelves or revolutionize our relationships with cats.
Still, the fact that these devices exist speak to the obsession humans seem to have with figuring out what their cats are thinking and feeling. Cats have a reputation for being hard to read – their mind is a “black box” – and some animal scientists have suggested that
cats are just too challenging to even study
.
But while a talking cat collar isn’t likely to solve the mystery of the meow, scientists have already discovered a few helpful things about human-cat communication and cats’ environmental needs.
A 20,000-year head start
Domestication of both dogs and cats has likely had a huge influence on their behavior, especially the way they interact with humans.
The coevolution of dogs and humans, however, can be traced back
approximately 30,000 years
, giving dogs a
20,000-year edge over cats
in wiggling their way into human companionship.
Because cats have had a much shorter period of coevolution with humans than dogs, they’ve been subject to less selection for facial expressions that we translate in dogs as “easy to read” and “human-like.” For example, we see something as simple as “eyebrow raising” in dogs
as a sign of sadness and vulnerability
.
For this reason, many will either dismiss cats as inscrutable, or use venues such as
LOLCats
to imagine what cats’ thoughts might be (mostly disparaging toward humans, it appears).
But humans are actually pretty good at reading some aspects of cat communication. Cornell psychologist Nicholas Nicastro
tested human perceptions of domestic cat vocalizations
and compared them to those of the cat’s closest wild relative, the African wild cat.
Our pet cats have meows that are shorter and of a higher pitch than their wild cousins. Humans tended to rate domestic cat cries as more pleasant and less urgent, showing that humans can identify which meows are from domestic cats and which are from a closely related wild cat. Meanwhile,
a 2009 study
demonstrated that humans could discriminate an “urgent” purr (one made by a cat while soliciting food from its owner) from a nonurgent one.
Communication breakdown
Many cat owners already assign meaning to meows, depending on their context. When your cat woefully cries at 5 a.m., you might be certain he wants food. But what if it’s just petting? Or wants to go outside?
This is where the cat-human communication seems to break down. People know their cat wants
something
. But they don’t seem to know just what.
Yes, but what is it that you’re actually trying to say?
'Cat' via www.shutterstock.com
Nicastro did
another study
that found people were just so-so at being able to assign meaning to a meow. Experimenters recorded cats when hungry (owner preparing food), in distress (in a car), irritated (being overhandled), affiliative (when the cat wanted attention) or when facing an obstacle (a closed door). Participants could classify the meows at a rate greater than chance, but their performance wasn’t great (just 34 percent correct).
A similar study
in 2015 by Dr. Sarah Ellis showed that even when the cat belonged to the participant, only four out of 10 humans could correctly identify the context of the different meows. And no one performed better than random chance when classifying meows of unfamiliar cats.
This suggests a few possibilities: meows might all sound the same to humans; perhaps some sort of learning occurs when we live with a cat that allows us to be slightly better at recognizing their meows over those of unfamiliar cats; or we might rely very heavily on context – not just the meow – to tell us what our cat might be thinking.
I have to admit, I’m not one of those people who finds cats difficult to understand. I accept that all cats have different needs than I do – and those needs include mental and physical stimulation (such as vertical space and play with interactive toys), appropriate outlets for normal feline behaviors (such as multiple litter boxes and scratching posts) and positive interactions with people (but as
research has shown
, in order to be positive, the interaction almost always needs to happen on the cat’s terms).
My bet? Those “urgent” 5 a.m. meows most often come from cats who either have learned that meowing is the only way to get attention or are not having their environmental and social needs met. But providing for those needs is going to be a lot more effective than trying to get your cat to talk to you through a novelty collar.
In its
press release
for the Catterbox, Temptation Labs claimed the device will “inject more fun” into a cat’s and human’s relationship. I can’t imagine it will be much fun for cats (who have
much more sensitive hearing than humans do
) to be subjected to a loud sound near their ears every time they meow.
At best, the Catterbox is a sorry attempt at a humorous ad campaign to sell cat treats. At worst, we have a product that does nothing to help us actually understand cats.
Instead we have a cat collar that promotes anthropomorphism and will probably simultaneously terrify the cats that are wearing it.
Talk about a lack of understanding."
Why does my cat pee on the rug? Are they trying to tell me something?,https://theconversation.com/why-does-my-cat-pee-on-the-rug-are-they-trying-to-tell-me-something-208935,"As cat researchers, one of the most common complaints we hear is:
My cat is a jerk! Whenever I do something he doesn’t like, he pees on my bed or the rug.
Often this complaint is based on an assumption the cat is seeking revenge or trying to send a message, The Godfather-style.
Unfortunately, a rhetoric has developed that cats are manipulative, vengeful, uncaring or even psychotic. This rhetoric means when cats do something we don’t like, it’s easy to reach for the idea they did it deliberately to hurt or annoy us.
But cats don’t behave the way humans do and their motives are not the same. They aren’t trying to irritate or punish us. So let’s forget the human rhetoric and delve into five reasons your cat might be peeing on your rug, bed or clothes.

Why does my dog eat grass? And when is it not safe for them?
1. It could be a medical issue
First, ask yourself: are they sick?
Many illnesses or injuries –
including
urinary tract infections, cystitis, diabetes and chronic pain – can cause a cat to have unusual urination behaviour.
Feline idiopathic cystitis
occurs in approximately 2-4% of cats worldwide. The exact causes are not known, although having an anxious or stressed cat increases the risk.
It’s often difficult to tell when a cat is sick. They are incredibly adept at
hiding pain
.
One clue is cats experiencing discomfort will want to pee somewhere they feel comfortable, often a place they associate with safety – such as your bed, your clothes or the rug.
One reason they may feel comfortable there is because it smells like you, someone they associate with positive feelings.
So if your cat pees somewhere odd, your first instinct should be to wonder if it’s time to contact your vet.

2. It could be short-term stress
Has something changed in your household lately? Are you renovating? Are there loud noises? Did a new cat move in next door? Did your friend bring their dog to visit?
Situations like these could lead to your cat feeling stressed and peeing in an unexpected place.
Log the days your cat pees somewhere unusual and see if a pattern emerges.
If it correlates with something in particular – such as a friend visiting with their dog – try to adapt the house set-up to make your cat more comfortable.
For instance, keep the dog outside or put your cat in your room with their food, water and a litter tray.
Think about how to make your cat more comfortable (or remove the stressor itself).
3. It could be chronic stress
Unlike a short-term stressor, chronic stress is an ongoing issue that can’t simply be stopped or removed.
This could be an ongoing stress from living in a multi-cat household or with a dog, or it could from a condition such as anxiety.
While chronic stress can be trickier to handle, it’s important to identify it and seek help.
Ongoing stress can lead to serious health issues such as cystitis, which can cause a urinary blockage and be
life threatening
. If your cat visits the litter tray and is straining without any result, this is an emergency. They need to see a vet as soon as possible.
Keep a short daily log and try to identify areas that may be causing ongoing stress for your cat.
Adjust the environment to limit these stressors and if needed, seek a veterinary behaviourist’s advice about treating potential anxiety in your cat.
And if you are very stressed, this might make your cat
feel stressed
. Sometimes you both need to take a deep breath!
Chronic stress can be tricky to handle.

Why do cats and dogs get the zoomies?
4. It could be the litter
Your cat’s “accidents” may be as simple as them not liking the substrate, tray or positioning of the litter they are given.
Cats want to feel comfortable and safe when they toilet. So they may not want to use it if:
the substrate you’re using hurts their paws or is too deep and makes them slide around
the tray is too small or too covered or
the litter is positioned somewhere that is disturbed easily.
Each cat is an individual; what works for one may not work for another. That said, here are some general rules for providing a pleasant litter experience for your cat:
provide one litter tray per cat plus an extra one for the household
litter depth should be enough to cover the bottom of the tray well but not so much that the cat’s weight makes them slip down into it
go for unscented litter (cats are very sensitive to smells)
place the tray in an area that has privacy and is away from any potential stressors such as children, dogs or loud noises
if possible, place the trays around the house in appropriate areas so your cat always has easy access when needed
scoop regularly and keep the tray clean.
5. It could because your cat is a jerk
Just kidding. This is never the reason."
Cats are not scared off by dingoes. We must find another way to protect native animals,https://theconversation.com/cats-are-not-scared-off-by-dingoes-we-must-find-another-way-to-protect-native-animals-123039,"Feral cats are wreaking havoc on our native wildlife, eating more than a billion animals across Australia every year. But managing feral cats and reducing their impacts on our threatened species is challenging, to say the least.
Aside from killing native animals, feral cats spread parasites and diseases such as
toxoplasmosis
which can kill native wildlife or make them more susceptible to predators.
To reduce these impacts, we must reduce feral cat populations. The difficulty is finding the right approach.
There have been
suggestions
that dingoes could help conserve biodiversity by controlling feral cats. But the evidence does not support this approach.
We investigated the relationship between dingoes and feral cats in central Queensland. Contrary to previous suggestions,
we found that
cats remained abundant, active and widespread, regardless of whether dingoes were present or absent, and regardless of where or when dingoes were active.
Our findings suggest that proposals to restore or reintroduce dingoes to protect threatened species may do more harm than good.

Some studies have reported fewer cats in areas with dingoes, concluding that dingoes must be suppressing cat numbers. However, these studies typically estimate the number of dingoes and cats using the number of
footprints on a sand plot
, counts from
spotlight searches
, or even the
raw number of images
captured on camera traps.
Unfortunately, all of these methods are known to be
poor measures of abundance
. Accordingly, whether or not dingoes suppress the abundance of cats remains hotly debated.

It has also been suggested that dingoes create a
‘landscape of fear’
, scaring cats and forcing them to change their behaviour to avoid dingoes. According to this hypothesis, dingoes might create cat-free periods or areas in the landscape, where threatened species could live without being harassed by cats.
By scaring cats away, some argue that dingoes might also prevent cats from hunting in the best areas, or hunting at the best times. Over time, this might even reduce cat populations by reducing their hunting success, body condition and breeding success.

Cats don’t give two hoots about dingoes
These suggestions might sound promising for conservation. But in reality, we found that
dingoes do not impact cat activity
.
Dingoes did not exclude cats from any patches, and cats were widespread across our study sites. Not only were cats and dingoes active in the same areas, cat activity was actually higher in patches where dingoes roamed than in areas where dingoes were absent. This suggests that dingoes do not create cat-free refuges in the landscape to protect threatened species.
Cats and dingoes were also active at the same times. While activity times for dingoes and cats overlapped at both sites, there was slightly less overlap at one site. But interestingly, this was because dingoes, not cats, had shifted their activity.

Cat densities at our sites were around 50% higher than the national average. This means that dingoes are not controlling cat numbers, either by killing or scaring cats, changing cat behaviour, or reducing their hunting or breeding success. Cats remained active, abundant and widespread across our sites, and our evidence suggests they also hunt and breed successfully in areas with dingoes.
A group of world-leading taxonomists recently determined that dingoes are
not a distinct species
, but actually a
type of dog
. Cats have lived around dogs for tens of thousands of years, and have clearly learned how to outsmart them in order to coexist. Our findings suggest that feral cats are no different to their domestic cousins in their ability to outsmart and coexist with dingoes.
Cats and dogs have co-existed for thousands of years, suggesting feral cats won’t easily be scared by dingoes.

Lessons from history
History is littered with examples of dingoes failing to protect threatened species from feral cats. Soon after European settlement, feral cats established and spread across Australia,
causing the extinction of dozens of Australian native mammal species
. This mass destruction occurred in the presence of dingoes, which had been introduced to Australia
up to 5000 years earlier
.
If the dingo couldn’t stop the spread of feral cats and protect threatened species from extinction while cats numbers were still low, it seems extremely unlikely that they could effectively suppress the
two to six million feral cats that occupy 99.8% of Australia today
.
The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the United States is often
touted as an example
of how dingoes could restructure Australian ecosystems and protect our biodiversity. But
Australia isn’t Yellowstone
, and dingoes aren’t wolves. Wolves are a native top-order predator in Yellowstone, while the dingo is merely an introduced middle-sized predator in Australia.
Feral cats were breeding and hunting successfully in areas with high dingo activity.
Bronwyn Fancourt
Dingoes eat threatened species too
Even if dingoes could suppress cats, dingoes are still predators that hunt and kill to survive. It is often
claimed
that dingoes are beneficial because they kill invasive pests and overabundant native animals. But they also kill the threatened species that they are supposed to protect.
For example, dingoes are the major predator of endangered adult
bridled nailtail wallabies
, and have contributed to the failure of reintroduction programs for other threatened species, including
northern quolls
and
burrowing bettongs
.

Australia is rapidly losing the fight to save our threatened species. 
Trapping, shooting and exclusion fencing can all help control cats in small areas, but these approaches are not feasible, sustainable or effective over large areas.
Better approaches are needed to control invasive predators such as feral cats and protect our threatened species. But using one introduced predator to control another introduced predator is clearly not the solution.

Four ways to tell if your cat loves you – based on science,https://theconversation.com/four-ways-to-tell-if-your-cat-loves-you-based-on-science-188170,"Even the most devoted cat owners wonder at some point, perhaps waking up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night, whether their cat really loves them. Dog people like to smugly point out
dogs’ long history
as humankind’s best friend.
But research shows cats’ reputation as a cold and aloof pet is undeserved.
Because of their evolutionary ancestry, domestic cats are, by their nature, more
independent than dogs. The wild ancestors of our cats didn’t live in social groups as canines do. However, during the process of domestication, cats developed the ability to form
social relationships
not just with other cats, but also with people.
While they may not
rely upon people
to feel safe as dogs do, many cats show affection towards their guardians and seem to highly value the company of
their human companions
. Their
attachment
to humans is partly influenced by their
experiences of being handled
by people
as a kitten
.
Cats behave towards humans in the same way that they respond to their feline friends, so the secret of whether your cat feels bonded to you lies in their behaviour.
1. Look out for scenting
The ability to communicate with other cats over long distances and when no longer
physically present was an advantage to
their wild ancestors
. Our pet cats have
retained this “supersense” and rely heavily on this
form of communication
.
In particular, cats
use scent
to identify members of their
social group or family
, by sharing a group scent profile. Cats have scent glands on their flanks, head and around their ears, and often rub their heads against people and objects that are
familiar and comforting
.
Does your cat rub its head or side against your legs? The soft sensation you feel against your calves is actually your cat
identifying you as a friend
and is a huge compliment.

2. Watch how they greet you
One of the most obvious signs that your beloved pet is fond of you, is the way that your cat greets you. When cats greet members of their social group they show signals to indicate friendship and a desire to move closer. Cats also show these signals to humans.
A tail held in the upright flagpole position shows a
friendly intention (the feline equivalent of a wave), indicating
familiarity,
trust, and affection
. Some cats also use an upright question mark shaped tail to
greet someone they like,
or to motion that they want to play.
Cats sometimes
intertwine their tails
as a sign of friendship and
the
human equivalent
of this is to wrap their tail around your calf.

Rolling over and exposing their vulnerable under belly is another gesture that a cat has ultimate trust in you. However cats prefer to be petted on the head and neck area, so this is not usually a request for a belly rub.
Attempts to stroke a cat’s belly will often result in a
hasty retreat, or even claws
. The chirrup or trill greeting is a melodious sound that cats make when saying hello to preferred individuals. So if your cat sings to you in this way, be assured they are pleased to see you.
That familiar feeling when your cat hits the back of your knee can also be a sign that they feel an extremely close bond to you. The feline version of a high-five, the head bump is usually saved for a cat’s closest feline friends and most trusted humans.
3. Look for blinks
Your cat might also be secretly signalling their affection in the way they look at you. When cats encounter strange humans or other cats they don’t know, they usually greet them with an unblinking stare. But they are more likely to slowly blink at cats they have a good relationship with.
Research suggests slow blinks are associated with a positive emotional state and can be a sign of trust,
contentment and affection
, similar to a human smile. If you wish to return the compliment, blink and your cat might blink back. This is nice a way to bond with your cat if they aren’t keen on being touched.

4. They get up close
Cats are very protective of their personal space and
don’t like unwelcome guests
to invade it. If a cat allows you to get close to them, that suggests a close bond, particularly where the contact is frequent or long lasting.
Curling up on your lap for a nap is a sign of deep trust. Grooming only happens between cats with a warm relationship, so licking your hand or face can be a show of endearment, even though those barbed tongues may not feel all that gentle."
"Keeping cats indoors: how to ensure your pet is happy,  according to science",https://theconversation.com/keeping-cats-indoors-how-to-ensure-your-pet-is-happy-according-to-science-126726,"By 2030, 60% of the world’s population
will live in cities
, while one in three will share their city with at least half a million other inhabitants. With more and more people living in dense urban settings, what does the future hold for pets?
High-rise living
might not be ideal for most pets
, as outdoor access can be difficult and there may be limited space indoors. For cats in particular, a trend towards indoor lifestyles might restrict how much they’re able to behave normally.
As the domesticated descendants of the African wild cat, cats are obligate carnivores – they need to have a meat-based diet. Naturally, this requires them to
hunt
. A study
in the US
found that pet cats could be killing up to four billion birds and up to 21 billion mammals every year.
So housebound cats may be good for wildlife, but how can people ensure their pets thrive indoors? Sadly, scientific research is pretty light on this question. Despite so many of us inviting them into our homes, we know relatively little about
how cats handle living inside
.
If allowed, cats will hunt outdoors. But their freedom comes at a cost to wildlife.

Choosing the right cat
We know that some cats are more suited to being house cats than others, although we need to be careful not to generalise. All cats have
individual needs
,
personalities and preferences
. High energy and hyperactive cats, rescued strays with little indoor experience or those that aren’t very friendly towards people aren’t good choices for a life lived entirely indoors.
It’s often assumed that older cats may be a better choice because they’re more sedentary and cats with a previous history of living indoors may also adjust more easily to a new indoor home. Some cats have diseases, such as feline immunodeficiency virus, that keep them housebound. But this doesn’t mean these groups of cats will all have the right temperament to cope with indoor living.
House cats are prone to obesity and may spend large amounts of time inactive, both physically and mentally. Providing a
safe
outdoor space for cats could be
beneficial for their wellbeing
.
Cat proofing
gardens, for example, so they can’t escape, could ensure pets can benefit from the outdoors in a more controlled way. But if this isn’t possible, there’s still much that can be done to improve a cat’s life indoors.
Personal space
Because cats are only considered semi-social, indoor environments may present several situations that they would
usually choose to avoid
. This can be anything from too much attention and unexpected guests to toddlers and other animals that don’t understand the concept of
mutual respect and personal space
.

How to stroke a cat, according to science
We know cats like boxes, but you can also give them high vantage points to climb to. To do this, you can use a “cat tree”, although an accessible shelf or the top of a wardrobe would work well too. Cats also need access to quiet rooms and spaces to hide under so they can remove themselves from situations they find stressful. Be mindful though – if your cat spends most of its time hiding, your house may be less cat-friendly than you think. Uncontrolled stress in a cat’s life can lead to
illnesses such as idiopathic cystitis
.
Predatory behaviour
But what about their need to hunt? Allowing this behaviour is vital, and that includes them being able to look for food as well as finding and eating it. Searching for food usually involves short bursts of activity and long periods of waiting in cats, while the feeding part is also complex, as the cat decides how and where is best to eat.
To recreate this, you can scatter food on the floor or hide it in
puzzle feeders
. You can even vary where you feed your cat and encourage it to explore and manipulate objects. Getting a cat to move more and eat regular, smaller amounts of food can help reduce the risk of obesity.
Play can also be used to mimic hunting without the need for food. It’s always best to keep bouts of play short, encouraging pouncing and chasing, and using toys which mimic the shape, texture and movement of live prey. You should always end on a positive note and while the cat is enjoying itself, so that future playtimes will be anticipated rather than endured.
Toys can help simulate the hunting experience for cats in the home.

Brushing up
Like humans, cats like to maintain themselves. Sharp claws are a must for effective climbing and defence, so make sure to provide scratching posts, especially if you want to protect your furniture. In the wild, cats use trees and other objects, not just to maintain their claws but also to leave marks for other cats to follow.
Make sure your cat can comfortably go to the toilet. Use unscented litter that is changed regularly and put the toilet in a discreet place, away from their food and water. For cats, as for us, it’s not a public activity. If your cat is going to the toilet somewhere inappropriate, it may be that they’re unhappy with their toilet arrangements or they may need to be checked by a vet.
Cats are as complex and each individual has unique needs. Before you decide whether to have an indoor cat, make sure that it’s a decision the cat would be likely to make too."
Do hypoallergenic cats even exist? 3 myths dispelled about cat allergies,https://theconversation.com/do-hypoallergenic-cats-even-exist-3-myths-dispelled-about-cat-allergies-191662,"Cats are great companions, but for some people their company comes at a cost.
Up to 1 in 5 people
have an allergic response to cats, and this figure is increasing.
There are many myths about allergies to cats, but what is fact and what is fiction? And can you still have a cat if you’re allergic?
Myth #1: People are allergic to cat hair
There is an element of truth to this myth. However, rather than the hair itself, substances
on
the hair are the source of the allergy. Most people allergic to cats react to a protein called Fel d 1. This main cat allergen is produced in the glands of the cat, including the
sebaceous
(oil-producing skin glands) and salivary glands.
While Fel d1 is the main culprit, domestic cats have
eight different potential allergens
. The second most common is Fel d 4, also produced in salivary glands.
Another type, Fel d 2, is similar to a protein found in  other animals, and the reason a person might be allergic, for example, to both cats and horses. This similarity can also result in a child with milk allergy having an increased risk of being allergic to animals like cats.
When cats groom themselves, they deposit the allergen in their saliva onto their hair. Sebaceous glands are close to the skin and can secrete onto the hair follicles. When you pet a cat’s fur, a reaction is set off, especially if you then rub your nose or eyes.
But you don’t need to pet a cat to have an allergic reaction to them. Simply being around dander can be enough. Dander might sound like a dating app for pets, but it’s actually more akin to animal dandruff, and contains tiny scales from hair or skin. As dander particles are so small, they float in the air and we often breathe them in.
When cats groom themselves, the allergen is transferred from their saliva onto their fur.

Myth #2: There are hypoallergenic cats
There is no evidence that specific cat breeds do not cause allergies. However, if some breeds have less hair, or shed less hair, this may reduce exposure to allergens in the environment.
For example, Sphynx cats are hairless, although they
still produce Fel d 1
. In this way
some breeds might be considered “hypoallergenic”
, or cause fewer allergic reactions. However, there are no scientific studies to confirm this is the case.
All cats produce Fel d 1, but the levels can differ by as much as
100-fold between individual cats
. This may explain why people with cat allergies notice they react more to some cats than others.
Sphynx cats have little to no hair, but they still produce allergens.

Myth #3: You have to re-home your cat if you have an allergy
If you have a life-threatening allergy to cats, your only alternative might be to find them a new home. However, most people have less severe reactions and can manage symptoms successfully.
Some things you can do to limit reactions include:
always wash your hands and avoid touching your face and eyes after handling your cat
regularly clean surfaces and change litter to reduce dander
wash your cat weekly with a pet-specific shampoo,
if
your cat likes being bathed
If the cat is amenable to baths, it can be a good method to reduce the level of allergens.
Matyas Rehak/Shutterstock
restrict cats’ access to rooms you want to keep allergy-free, such as the bedroom
get a vacuum specifically designed for reducing allergens, such as ones with a HEPA filter
use air purifiers with HEPA filters.
Adopting a cat when allergic
If you’re allergic and want to adopt a cat, make sure to spend some time with them first to assess your reaction. Ideally, pick a cat that doesn’t make you sneeze.
If cats need to be re-homed, this does negatively affect their welfare. A
large study of RSPCA shelters in Australia
reported allergy as the reason for relinquishment in roughly 3% of cats out of 61,755 total relinquished between 2006 and 2010.
Adopting a cat is a serious commitment.
Roberto Huczek/Unsplash
You can also see your doctor about options for managing symptoms such as over-the-counter medications (such as antihistamines) and longer term solutions.
For those with allergies who want to have their cat and their ability to breathe too,
another option is immunotherapy
, although there is limited evidence to support this treatment for cat allergies.
Immunotherapy involves first identifying which specific allergen is causing the reactions, and then systematically delivering increasing levels of this allergen over several months in an effort to retrain the immune system to tolerate the allergen without a reaction. This may be especially beneficial for those with moderate to severe reactions.

I’m considering allergen immunotherapy for my hay fever. What do I need to know?
There is evidence
exposure to dogs and cats early in life can reduce at least some forms of allergy
. Evidence is still conflicting, though, and probably depends on genetics and other environmental factors.
What we do know is that pet cats provide companionship and joy to many, and understanding the causes and treatment of pet allergy can only help both cats and humans."
Can Tassie devils control feral cats? The devil is in the detail,https://theconversation.com/can-tassie-devils-control-feral-cats-the-devil-is-in-the-detail-37151,"Recently there have been discussions around
reintroducing Tasmanian devils
to parts of the Australian mainland. Some have even predicted that devils could help conserve biodiversity by
controlling the feral cats and foxes
that currently prey on a range of threatened species.
Some of these predicted benefits are said to be based on
“evidence from Tasmania”
. But how much evidence do we really have?
As part of a study investigating the cause of
decline of the eastern quoll
, we and our colleagues investigated interactions between devils, feral cats and quolls in Tasmania. Our findings published today in
PLOS ONE
suggest that there’s no easy answer to the devil and cat conundrum.
A feral cat walks between feeding devils in a Tasmanian free range enclosure, but how much do we know about their interactions in the wild?
Simon Plowright/Bicheno FRE, Natureworld
What’s the link between cats and devils?
In Tasmania, it has been
suggested
that devils may control feral cats through competition and possibly predation. With devil populations currently being
decimated
by the spread of the fatal
Devil Facial Tumour Disease
(DFTD), it was predicted that devil declines would allow
feral cat numbers to increase
, threatening a range of small and medium-sized prey species.
In north east Tasmania (where DFTD was
first detected in 1996
and devils have been in decline the longest), government spotlight surveys detected an
increase in cat sightings
following devil decline.
This increase in cat sightings has often been interpreted as an increase in cat numbers, with suggestions that
eastern quoll declines may then be linked to an increase in cats
. While this interpretation might fit with predictions, our findings suggest that such conclusions may be premature.
Contrary to predictions, we found
no support
for the hypothesis that devils control cat numbers. Sites with more devils did not have fewer cats, and conversely, sites with fewer devils did not have more cats.
Further, we did not find higher cat numbers in north east Tasmania where devils had declined for 13-16 years.
So how do we explain the increase in cat sightings?
Scaredy cats
Devils might not control the number of cats – but they may affect their behaviour.
The key for predators to co-exist is avoidance. By concentrating activity into
times
and
places
where large predators are less active, smaller predators such as cats reduce the risk of aggressive encounters with larger predators such as devils.
In our study, we found that cats and devils used the same areas, with cats observed at 92% of sites where devils were detected. While cats appeared to avoid individual cameras where devils were detected (a finding consistent with
other studies
), they were usually detected on cameras located only a few hundred metres away at the same site. This suggests that cats may avoid areas where devils are active, but only over short distances.
We also found evidence that cats and devils were active at different times. Cats were more active during the day, but in north east Tasmania where devils have been in decline the longest, cats were more active at night.
This suggests that cats may have previously hunted during the day to avoid nocturnally active devils. But with fewer devils to encounter following DFTD, it may now be safer for cats to shift their activity and hunt at night.
Even without an increase in cat numbers, this apparent shift in cat activity presents an emerging threat to a range of nocturnal prey species that may have rarely seen cats prior to DFTD.
If cats are now more active at night following devil decline, the increase in cat sightings in north east Tasmania may simply reflect a shift in cat activity times, with nocturnal cats now more detectable in spotlight surveys conducted at night.
Cat activity times (blue line) compared with spotlight survey times (grey shading). Cats were more nocturnal in north east Tasmania (early DFTD region, where DFTD arrived 1996-1999) and would likely be more detectable in spotlight surveys than in the mid DFTD region (DFTD arrived 2000-2003).
Bronwyn Fancourt
Are cats to blame for quoll declines?
Eastern quolls have declined by
more than 50%
over the 10 years to 2009 with no sign of recovery. Our research investigated whether this decline might have been linked with changes in cat populations following devil declines.
Contrary to predictions, we found no evidence that cats contributed to the recent quoll decline. But our findings suggest that cats might be preventing populations from recovering by killing young quolls.
Eastern quoll declines do not appear to be caused by any increase in feral cats.
Bronwyn Fancourt
At a stable quoll site on Bruny Island, the number of quolls trapped predictably increased over summer as new young quolls emerged - an annual cycle that has been observed historically in stable quoll populations.
However, at our three study sites where quolls had declined, this summer population spike did not occur, suggesting that juveniles are not surviving to enter the population, possibly because cats are eating them.
We found that cat activity changed seasonally, with daytime activity in winter but more nocturnal activity in summer – the time of year when vulnerable juvenile quolls first emerge from their dens.
Unfortunately, this predation intensity may increase further should cats become more nocturnal following devil decline.
The outlook
We have only just begun to understand how devils, cats and quolls interact in Tasmania. Extensive research is currently underway that will hopefully provide us with some much needed insights over coming years.
We provide a cautionary tale that highlights the need to consider alternative hypotheses to explain observed patterns, as the implications for species conservation could vary dramatically.
Bold decisions and novel approaches are required to stem the rising tide of
Australian mammal extinctions
. Proposals to reintroduce devils to the mainland are commendable and may potentially yield benefits for species conservation.
However, our findings from Tasmania suggest that the predicted benefits of such reintroductions may not be so predictable."
"Cats like to play fetch, as long as it’s on their terms – new research",https://theconversation.com/cats-like-to-play-fetch-as-long-as-its-on-their-terms-new-research-219726,"Cats have a reputation
for being aloof
(some may even say lazy) – but our
new research
has found they
interact with their owners
in surprising ways. What we discovered also shows how important this
kind of interaction
can be for cats’ wellbeing.
Fetching behaviour in domestic cats has been
reported to be
more common than coming when called, meowing on command, or playing games. There may also be breed differences in fetching (at least among purebreds). For example,
Siamese cats
and their crossbreed variations are known for being proficient fetchers.
We wanted to know more about how and why cats fetch. In an online survey, we asked owners of cats who play fetch about this behaviour. Almost all of these cats (94.4%) had not been trained to fetch, and most were young (less than one year old) when their owners first noticed they could fetch.
At the time of our survey, these cats had on average fetched for approximately four years. But there was a lot of variation – some were new fetchers, while others had played fetch for their whole lives.
What we learned
We discovered that cats prefer to be in control of their fetching sessions. According to their owners, the cats that usually initiate fetching sessions seem more enthusiastic about it. These cats both had more fetching sessions per month and retrieved the object more times in a single play session.
Most of the cats in our sample were mixed breed (86%). Out of the purebreds, Siamese were the most common (22.5%), supporting their reputation as fetchers.
Fetching cats preferred to play fetch with toys such as imitation mice and catnip toys. But they also made the most of their surroundings and would opportunistically fetch items such as crumpled paper, hair ties or bottle caps.
Some cats prefer to play with crumpled paper.

Overall, the owners reported lots of differences in fetching behaviour. Some cats bring the object to their owner first, while others respond to their owner throwing an object first. Some cats only bring the object back halfway. Some are fussy with the objects they want to play with, and some will only fetch at certain times or in particular areas of the house (like up and down the stairs).
Playful cats
When cats play, they look similar to when they hunt. For example,
chasing, biting, leaping
and stalking their prey or object of choice. Hunting is a natural behaviour for cats, so they need an outlet for it.
Play has important benefits for pet cats in terms of preventing aggression towards humans, and acting as a
substitution for predation on live animals
.
Owners can also learn about
the needs of their cats through play sessions
, such as how long they like to play for, and thus help strengthen their bond. Young cats are most likely to be playful, both with objects and littermates. But we don’t know much about how play in adult cats differs from play in kittens or young cats, because there is only limited
research into how adult cats play
.
While there also hasn’t been a lot of research into the bond between cats and their owners, some studies have shown this relationship is an important one. For example, a
2017 study in Sweden
found that cats sought more social contact with their owner after being left alone for 30 minutes – they coped well on their own, but their behaviour changed when their owner returned home.
Playtime is good for cats.
Viacheslav Lopatin/Shutterstock
It’s important for owners to put time aside to play with their cat each day. Short periods of play a few times a day are enough – and it doesn’t have to be a game of fetch. If cats enjoy playing fetch on their own terms, that probably applies to all kinds of play. Generally, they prefer toys that have features of prey – for example,
toys that can break or pull apart
, or
that move erratically
(like toys on a rod).
Owners can learn and understand what their cat’s behavioural signals mean during a play session. When a cat wants their owner to play with them, they might bring a toy to their owner or sit next to a toy and stare expectantly at their owner. Examples of behaviour that shows a cat wants to end the play session include lying down, walking away from the area, or no longer chasing after a toy when it’s thrown.
If owners can read and interpret the body language of their cat and know when to start or end a play session, the cat will enjoy this experience and may open up more playing opportunities in the future – perhaps even building up to fetch!"
The curious character of cats – and whether they are really more aloof,https://theconversation.com/the-curious-character-of-cats-and-whether-they-are-really-more-aloof-75512,"To some people, cats are the perfect pet. Intelligent, elegant, calming companions, capable of dealing with their own exercise and cleaning. To others, they are frustratingly independent, cool and aloof. So what is the true nature of the domestic cat?
The cats many of us choose to share our homes with did indeed evolve from a solitary species, the African wildcat (
Felis silvestris lybica
). But feral domestic cats can form colonies, based on friendly and reciprocal relationships when resources are plentiful.
This capacity to live in social groups has been exploited by humans for thousands of years. Before realising their value as animal companions, communities initially took advantage of the cat’s prowess as predators of vermin species to safeguard crops. Cats are now one of the most popular companion animal species in the world. There are over 10m estimated to be
living in the UK alone
, and around 25% of UK households own at least one cat.
So cats clearly share some characteristics with other pet species to make them such a popular addition to the home. They are able to satisfy people’s need for a human-animal bond, providing owners with social and emotional support. And the fact that cats often engage in undesirable behaviours (from an owner’s perspective) such as hunting, mean that that bond must have the capacity to be very strong.
Cats have not been as commonly studied as dogs when it comes to social behaviour and people (possibly because they are not perceived to be such willing subjects). Nevertheless,
studies
have shown that cats form affectionate bonds with their owners. (Although there is still some debate as to whether this is actually a preference for a person who provides safety and security.)
Although cats are known to show a preference for interacting with their owners over strangers, the social behaviour of cats can vary. The quality of human-to-cat interactions can also be influenced by the owners’ gender, age and how much time they have available. Cats
appear to have the best relationship
with owners who are adult women. Differences in human behaviour may
help explain
the varying quality of these relationships. For example,
men are thought to be more likely
to interact with cats while seated whereas woman tend to interact with cats at their level, normally on the floor.
A behavioural study? What’s in it for me?
Shutterstock
Adults also usually call to a cat before interacting, allowing the cat to decide whether to respond or not.
Children, especially boys
, tend to approach cats directly, which may not be tolerated well by individual cats. Interactions initiated by the cat itself tend to be longer than those initiated by the human.
The cat’s sociability towards humans therefore ranges from “very independent” to “very attached”. Where an individual cat lies on this spectrum is likely to be related to genes and previous learning experiences – that familiar mixture of nature and nurture. For example, feral kittens who have positive experiences with several different people in their early developmental stage (before six or seven weeks of age) are more likely to respond well to handling and become satisfying “good” pets than feral kittens which are first handled after the end of this period.
Having kittens
According to research
, paternal friendliness, as well as socialisation to people, affects responses to people throughout a cat’s life. Kittens with friendly fathers and which have been socialised were shown to be more friendly. Kittens of friendly fathers that had not been socialised were less so. They were also more friendly than kittens that had been socialised to people but had unfriendly fathers. Breed may also influence how friendly cats are to people. Owners of Siamese and Persians
report higher levels of affection
than owners of non-pedigree cats, for example.
Toys, food and scents
Recent
research
has attempted to further investigate cat sociability by comparing their preferences for interacting with people to their preferences for food, toys and scents. The authors found similar numbers of cats that preferred human interaction to those who preferred food.
Significantly lower numbers of cats preferred toys and scents. The preference of some cats for playing or petting interactions with people over food is contrary to the age-old belief that people are just cats’ servants, who only tolerate people because they provide food. This view is also
disputed by findings
that providing food in the absence of other social interactions from the human carer, such as speaking or stroking, cannot maintain a social bond.

So, are domestic cats aloof? There is no easy answer to this. Cats have the capacity to be very affectionate towards their owners and form significant bonds. But this largely depends on their genetic predispositions and early life experiences with people.
Owner demographics and cat–directed behaviour will also influence the quality of cat-owner interactions and relationships. The degree of aloofness in the domestic cat is likely to be very individual. Potential owners should get to know a cat well before taking it into their home as a companion and respecting the cat’s choice to interact."
"Why does my cat wake me up so early, and what can I do about it?",https://theconversation.com/why-does-my-cat-wake-me-up-so-early-and-what-can-i-do-about-it-180959,"You’ve got an important meeting in the morning and your cat wakes you at 4am. Why? And what can you do to stop this happening again?
Although cats are evolved for night-time activity, during domestication they have adapted to human lifestyles.
Domestic cats tend to be most active early in the morning and at dusk, not in the middle of the night. They also change their
activity cycles
to fit in with their human housemates.
This means if you sleep at night, your cat should also be resting. And a lot of people do sleep with their cat. In a
survey
of women in the US, around 30% slept with at least one cat.
So why do some cats want to play in the wee hours?
The reason

your cat is waking you up will often help you understand how to stop them. Here are three reasons your cat might be waking you up and how to address the issue.

Cool for cats: that spiny tongue does more than keep a cat well groomed
1. They’re hungry
This is among the most common reasons. Unfortunately, one of the first things a sleepy person will do is feed their cat. This rewards the behaviour and makes the cat more likely to repeat it.
To start addressing this problem, make sure your cat is getting enough to eat throughout the day. You can feed them a meal or a satisfying snack right before you go to bed.
If you usually feed your cat in the morning, you need to make sure your cat is not associating wake up time with breakfast time. Leave a gap between when you get out of bed and when you feed kitty breakfast – aim for at least half an hour.
You can also train your cat to associate something else with getting fed, such as saying “breakfast time!”.
If you usually feed your cat in the morning, you need to make sure your cat is not associating wake up time with breakfast time.

2. They don’t have a routine
Cats love predictability.
Keeping a regular routine has even been associated with
reduced stress levels
in cats.
To maintain a routine, keep mealtimes, play times and any grooming close to the same time each day.
Empty litter at regular, predictable intervals (dirty or disturbed litter may also be a reason your cat is waking you up). Try not to move litter trays, bowls or scratch posts around unless needed.
If something changes in their environment – you go on holiday, move furniture or have a new house guest or pet – your cat may return to early morning wake up calls. This is typical for cats.
Keep the routine as consistent as you can and eventually your cat will settle in to the new normal.
Keeping a regular routine has been associated with reduced stress levels in cats.

3. They’re not using up their energy throughout the day
It’s common knowledge cats love to sleep, but they also love to play and move their bodies just like us.
It’s important to give your cat access to a variety of toys and resources around the house to interact with, especially if you’re not home often.
Scratch posts offer cats a place to climb and stretch. Balls, soft and motorised toys give them an opportunity to play and exercise.
When you are home, engage your cat with an interactive toy (like a cat wand) or play a game of chase around the house. You can even try making up a game your cat will enjoy.
Cats get bored easily. Keep variety in your play times. And don’t play with your cat in the hour before you want to go to bed. Ideally, a play session before you go out and once you get home should help to keep your kitty quiet overnight.

Help! I’ve made these changes and my cat still woke me up!
Your cat might still wake you up for some time. This behaviour may even get worse in the short term as your cat adjusts. The key is to ignore your cat’s behaviour at night or in the early morning. Don’t get up and, if you can, don’t interact with your cat when they wake you.
If you’ve tried everything and your cat still wakes you up, it’s time to go to see your veterinarian. There might be a health reason causing the behaviour.
Hopefully, you and your cat can come to an agreement about when it’s sleep time and when it’s wake-up time. It is definitely possible to love your cat and still get your sleep.

Five things to consider before getting a feline companion"
Why you should train your cat – and how to do it,https://theconversation.com/why-you-should-train-your-cat-and-how-to-do-it-188307,"The pandemic fuelled a
rise
in first-time pet owners and people adopting puppies and kittens. While even inexperienced owners expect a new puppy will need some training, people rarely think the same applies to kittens.
But just like dogs, cats need support to
adjust to living alongside us
. Simple forms of training can be good for their wellbeing.
Compared to dogs, cats share
different historic relationships
with humans. Cats have never been selectively bred to enhance their ability to cooperate and communicate with us, or perform working roles such as herding, hunting or guarding. But research shows they can
recognise and respond
to our subtle
social cues
and be trained to perform
similar tasks to dogs
.
However, it’s unlikely we would need a cat to “walk nicely” on a lead, or settle quietly at the pub. And cats typically need less support than dogs to master toilet training – providing the
right litter tray
is usually sufficient.
But we are missing a trick if we only think about training pets to make our lives easier. Myself and colleague Daniel Cummings of animal charity Cats Protection would argue that there are many possible benefits to the cat also. In a rehoming shelter, for example, training can be a useful tool to increase a
cat’s exploratory behaviours
, positive reactions to people and maybe even their chances of being adopted.
At home, we can use simple techniques to help cats with things like feeling comfortable in a cat carrier, getting used to car journeys, as well as
tolerating being groomed
and receiving basic
health examinations and treatments
. Such training can also help cats
cope better
with visits to the vet.
What works
Cats are not born with an innate affinity towards humans and must be exposed to
gentle, warm
handling from two weeks old so they can learn we are friend rather than foe. There is
limited evidence
that younger cats are more attentive to our social cues, which could mean they are more amenable to training. Kittens should also be played with using cat wands or fishing rod toys so that they learn not to attack our hands or feet.
Punishments such as shouting, rough handling or using a water spray can induce stress and compromise the quality of
owner-cat relationships
. Always use positive reinforcement (such as treats and praise). This is not only the
most effective way to train
pets, but it’s also
better for their wellbeing
.
Reward-based techniques can be an excellent way to teach a cat to enter a carrier on their own or sit calmly whilst we deliver their flea treatment. Some very friendly food motivated cats may enjoy being taught to give a high five, or to sit or spin.
But cats are often less motivated than dogs to pay attention to us, or do what we are asking, especially in situations where they don’t feel comfortable. These factors may explain the
high drop-out rates
in studies that involve training cats to attend to human social cues.
It’s important that we make sure the cat is somewhere they feel at ease when we undertake any training with them. Always ensure the cat has the option to walk away or end the session when they want and try to give them a break if they seem uncomfortable. Signs to look for include the cat turning their head away, nose licking, head shaking, a raised paw, sudden bouts of self-grooming, looking hunched or tense, a twitching or thumping tail and rotated or flattened ears.
Remember to take training in little steps.

Here’s how to teach your cat enter a carrier and settle in five easy steps:
1. Lure them onto a blanket
In a place where your cat already feels safe, teach him or her to
settle on a blanket. Do this by luring the cat onto the blanket using food.
Reward the cat for staying on the blanket with more treats, petting or verbal praise, depending on what your cat likes most. Feed treats at nose height to encourage them into a sit position, then feed treats at ground height to encourage the cat to crouch and then eventually lay on the blanket.
2. Introduce the carrier
Once your cat has mastered step one, place the blanket on the bottom of a carrier
with the lid removed. Repeat the same luring and rewarding steps.
3. Take it slowly
When your cat is happily resting on the blanket in the carrier, place the lid on top of the carrier (without attaching the door) and repeat the luring and rewarding process.
4. Let your cat set the pace
After your cat has happily entered the carrier and settled inside, place the door on the carrier but keep it open to start with, so that he or she doesn’t suddenly feel trapped inside. Allow them to exit the carrier when they want and use treats to encourage them back in. In small movements, start to close the door slightly then open it again, each time giving the cat a treat. Build this up slowly until the door can be fully closed (for only a few seconds at first) while the cat is still comfortable. Feed the cat treats through the closed door.
5. Almost there
Work towards the cat being in the carrier with the door closed for longer periods, adding a few extra seconds each time. Keep rewarding the cat by popping treats through the sides or door of the carrier, gradually increasing the time between each treat delivery. Each training session should last no more than a few minutes in total, and some cats may prefer only one session a day. It might take lots of sessions and many days or weeks before this final step is complete."
Why does my cat kick litter all over the place? 4 tips from cat experts,https://theconversation.com/why-does-my-cat-kick-litter-all-over-the-place-4-tips-from-cat-experts-186928,"Does your cat kick litter all over the floor? What does this mean and how can you stop it?
Despite being skilled predators, cats are also
mesopredators
, meaning they are both predators and prey. Unlike apex predators at the top of the food chain with no natural predators, cats are in the middle, preying on smaller animals and being preyed upon by larger animals.
Because they are also a prey animal, cats developed instinctive behaviours to protect them from nearby predators. One of these behaviours is digging in the litter tray. Cats likely dig and cover their waste to hide their presence from visiting predators, who might be attracted by the scent.
Covering waste may also help cats to avoid
parasites
.

Cats likely dig and cover their waste to hide their presence from visiting predators.
Shutterstock
Cat waste also acts as an important
communicator
to other cats in the area, signalling how long ago a cat came through, a female that may be in heat or many other messages a cat may leave behind.
Which brings us to: what can you do about it, so your cat isn’t kicking litter everywhere?
In terms of changing the cat’s behaviour, the short answer is: nothing. Digging is a natural and important behaviour and trying to interrupt that may cause stress and confusion for your cat.
In fact, cats who dig in their litter box for longer probably like their litter box more and are
less likely to have problems with pooing or weeing
. 
Inappropriate pooing or weeing, especially outside the litter tray, can indicate urinary problems in cats.
In a survey
, of Australian cats around 20% pooed or weed outside the litter tray.
There are some simple solutions in setting up litter trays that can keep you and your cat happy – and litter in the tray.
Digging is a natural and important behaviour for cats.
Shutterstock
1. Litter hygiene (you, not them)
Have you ever had to pull a gross bit of food from the sink? Your cat may feel similarly about placing their paws in a dirty litter box.
Your cat’s hesitance to use their dirty litter tray may be leading them to hedge their bets, sticking to the edge, where the litter is less soaked, and kicking litter all over the floor.
The solution:
Clean the tray regularly. Ideally, remove solid waste as it happens or once a day, and completely change over the litter every few days or before the top layer becomes soaked.
Clean your cats tray regularly.
Shutterstock
2. Overfilled litter
When it comes to filling the litter tray, more isn’t always better.
For cats with health issues such as arthritis, pain or restricted mobility, an overfilled litter box means trying to balance on an unstable mound of litter. And the more litter in the tray, the more litter that can end up on the floor.
Even cats without health issues may feel the need to dig deeper to find a stable surface to squat on. This means more litter on the floor both because of the increased volume and the cats extra efforts in digging.
The solution:
Fill the tray with around 2-4cm (1-2 inches) of litter.
When it comes to filling the litter tray, more isn’t always better.
Shutterstock
3. Litter box number and choice
The general rule of thumb is one litter tray per cat plus one for the household. These should be placed around the house if possible, in places where your cats feel safe to go about their business.
Many litter boxes are too small. If your cat is constantly kicking litter around, try investing in a larger box. A covered litter box may be a solution, but cats are individuals too and some don’t like being cooped up when trying to poo or wee.
Many litter trays are too small.
Shutterstock
You can find trays with higher sides or an additional edge that hangs over and stops some of the litter from flying.
If you can’t find something large enough or suitable, you can try making your own from something as simple as a plastic washing tub.
A great way to work out which type of litter box your cat prefers is to place two different types side by side and see which one they use the most.
4. Wipe your paws
If it’s not any of the above, its possible your cat just has a real zest for kicking up litter.
If the litter on the floor is a real problem for you, you can  place specific mats around the litter or in the doorway to the room(s) where the litter is.
These mats help to collect the litter as the cat walks over them, containing that kicked up mess to a smaller area and stopping litter from being tracked into your other rooms.
Maybe your cat just likes kicking up litter.
Shutterstock
Toileting outside the litter box may indicate a behavioural or medical problem. If making the changes suggested above doesn’t help do consult your veterinarian.
If your cat is squatting frequently without much result, you should consult your veterinarian as quickly as possible.

Curious Kids: How can you tell if your cat is happy and likes you?"
"Cats carry diseases that can be deadly to humans, and it’s costing Australia $6 billion every year",https://theconversation.com/cats-carry-diseases-that-can-be-deadly-to-humans-and-its-costing-australia-6-billion-every-year-147910,"Toxoplasmosis, cat roundworm and cat scratch disease are caused by pathogens that depend on cats — pets or feral — for part of their life cycle. But these diseases can be passed to humans, sometimes with severe health consequences.
In
our study
published today in the journal Wildlife Research, we looked at the rates of these diseases in Australia, their health effects, and the costs to our economy.
Professor Sarah Legge discusses the key findings of the study.
Based on findings from a large number of Australian and international studies, Australian hospital data and information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we estimate many thousands of people in Australia fall ill or sustain a minor injury as a result of cat-dependent diseases each year.
Our estimations suggest more than 8,500 Australians are hospitalised and about 550 die annually from causes linked to these diseases.
We calculated the
economic cost
of these pathogens in Australia at more than A$6 billion per year based on the costs of medical care for affected people, lost income from time off work, and other related expenses.
Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is an illness caused by the parasite
Toxoplasma gondii
. It’s the most serious cat-dependent disease.
Newly infected cats shed millions of
T. gondii
oocysts (like tiny eggs)
in their poo
and these can
survive many months
in the environment.
Humans become infected when they ingest these oocysts, which are in the soil and dust in
places where cats have defecated
, especially sandpits, vegetable gardens or kitty litter.
Humans can also become infected from eating undercooked meat, if those farm animals have come into contact with cat-shed oocysts.

Once infected, about
10%
of people develop illness; the other 90% have no symptoms.
Based on overall infection rates and Australia’s population size, we estimate there are more than 125,000 new infections in Australia each year.
Of these, around 12,500 people get sick, mostly with non-specific, flu-like symptoms that resolve within a couple of weeks; 650 require hospitalisation, and 50 die, with these more serious cases often experiencing

Long-term impacts of latent infection
Even if the initial infection causes little illness, the
T. gondii
parasite stays with us for life, encased in a cyst, often in the brain. These “latent” infections may
affect our mental health
and behaviour, such as delaying our reaction times.
Many studies have found people with
T. gondii
infection are
more likely to have a car accident
. A
review of several studies
found if there were no
T. gondii
infections, car accident rates would theoretically be 17% lower.
T. gondii
infections also appear more common in people with mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, and in people who attempt suicide. Reviews across many studies suggest that without
T. gondii
infections, there could be 10% fewer
suicides
and 21% fewer
schizophrenia
diagnoses.
There’s still debate over whether the parasite
causes
car accidents and mental health disorders, or whether the association is explained by another shared factor. But it is possible
T. gondii
infection is a risk factor for these issues, in the same way
smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks
.
Scientists are still discovering how
T. gondii
influences the brain, but studies on rodents suggest it may involve
changed brain chemistry
or
inflammation
.
Putting it all together
If we accept
T. gondii
infections do increase the risk of car accidents, suicides and schizophrenia, then considering the incidence of these accidents and health issues in Australia, without
T. gondii
, we estimate we could potentially avoid:
200 deaths and 6,500 hospitalisations due to car accidents
300 suicides and 4,500 suicide attempts
800 schizophrenia diagnoses each year.
Combining deaths from car accidents and suicide with the 50 deaths from acute toxoplasmosis, we reach a total of 550 deaths related to
T. gondii
infection per year.
The hospitalisation total for
T. gondii
includes 650 for acute toxoplasmosis, 50 for congenitally infected babies, 6,500 for car accidents, and 800 for schizophrenia. We didn’t include hospitalisations for suicide attempts, as we didn’t have statistics on that. So this could be a conservative estimate, notwithstanding the fact there are other factors involved in car accidents and mental health issues.
Cat scratch and roundworm
Cat scratch disease
is a bacterial infection (
Bartonella henselae
) that people can contract if bitten or scratched by an infected cat.
Typical symptoms include sores, fevers, aches and swollen glands. But
more serious symptoms
, such as inflammation of heart tissue, cysts in the organs and loss of vision, can also occur.
Prevalence figures are not available in Australia, but based on
rates in the United States and Europe
, where cat ownership patterns and cat infection rates are similar, we estimate at least 2,700 Australians get sick annually from cat scratch disease, and 270 are hospitalised.

What can we do?
Some
700,000
feral cats and another
2.7 million
pet cats roam our towns and suburbs acting as reservoirs of these diseases.
There are no human vaccines for these diseases. Treatment for
T. gondii
infection in cats isn’t
considered useful
because cats usually shed the oocysts without the owner even realising the cat has the parasite. Cats can be treated to rid them of roundworm, but treatment for
B. henselae
(the bacteria that causes cat scratch) may not be
effective
.
But if you’re a cat owner, there are some things you can do. Keeping pet cats indoors or in a securely contained outdoor area could reduce the chance your pet will contract or pass on a disease-causing pathogen.
If cats are always kept indoors they have a low risk of catching and spreading the disease.

Cats should be kept out of veggie gardens and children’s sandpits. Washing hands after handling kitty litter and gardening, and washing vegetables thoroughly, can also reduce the risk of transmission.
As
T. gondii
can be contracted from infected meat, cooking meat well before eating, and not feeding raw meat to pets, can also help.

Feral feast: cats kill hundreds of Australian animals,https://theconversation.com/feral-feast-cats-kill-hundreds-of-australian-animals-35555,"Feral cats are estimated to eat tens of millions of native animals
each night
in Australia. But what kinds of wildlife are they eating? In
research published today
in the Journal of Biogeography, my colleagues and I show that cats kill hundreds of different kinds of animals, including at least 16 species considered globally threatened.
Feral cats are a serious threat to wildlife globally, contributing to the extinction of numerous birds, mammals and reptiles
worldwide
. In Australia, cats have been implicated in the extinction of at least 20 mammal species and sub-species, including the lesser bilby and desert bandicoot.
Cats are widespread across the country, so it’s likely that their diet varies according to the local environment and fauna community – which might be affected by many factors, such as the amount of rainfall that an area receives or the native plant life.
Knowing what cats eat can help us decide how best to manage them.

What we found supports earlier research – the feral cat is an opportunistic predator - a generalist carnivore that eats a wide range of wildlife across Australia.

Feral cats help themselves to a phenomenal number of species in Australia – 400 different vertebrates. This includes 123 bird species, 157 reptiles, 58 marsupials, 27 rodents, 21 frogs and nine exotic medium- and large-sized mammals. This is more than double the 179 species of animals that cats have been
recorded
eating on other islands worldwide.
However, this list only includes those species that have been recorded in diet studies, so it’s likely that there are many other species of native animals that cats kill and eat, that we just don’t know about yet.
Feral cats also eat many threatened species in Australia, and have been
implicated in the decline
of many species including the bilby, numbat, and
western ground parrot
.
We found that cats kill at least 16 globally threatened species and 12 others classed as near-threatened. This include mammals like the critically endangered mountain pygmy-possum and the brush-tailed bettong (
woylie
); the endangered northern quoll; as well as the critically endangered Christmas Island whiptail-skink and the vulnerable malleefowl.

Desert desserts
What feral cats eat varies depending on where they are.
In our study, cats ate rodents most often in Australia’s tropical north. They ate medium-sized mammals, such as possums and bandicoots, most frequently in the south-east of the country. Still, cats ate rodents three times more often than other small, carnivorous mammals known as dasyurids (like dunnarts for example).
Cats also ate many mammals from a group that has suffered severe declines and extinctions over the past 200 years. These are known as “critical weight range” mammals, and weigh between 0.35 and 5.5 kilograms. Unfortunately, these mammals make suitable sized prey for many predatory species such as the feral cat and the introduced red fox.
What cats eat also depends on the amount of rainfall an area receives. Cats fed on reptiles most frequently in the central deserts, where rainfall is lowest. These deserts are also the most reptile-rich part of Australia (and the world).
Cats commonly feed on another widespread pest species: rabbits. Where cats ate fewer rabbits, the frequency of small mammals (rodents and dasyurids) in their diet increased. In Australia’s tropical north where rabbits are mostly absent, cats ate the highest frequency of rodents and dasyurids of anywhere in the country.
Rabbits are a major food source for feral cats.

This has important implications for how we manage pest animals. If rabbits are culled from an area, but cats aren’t controlled at the same time, then cats might switch prey and eat more small native mammals.
Past experience tells us how these programs can go awry. For example, when feral cats were eradicated from Macquarie Island in 2000, rabbit numbers exploded because the cats had kept the rabbits in check. Rabbits caused severe damage to the island’s native vegetation before being
eradicated themselves in 2014
. This suggests that a multi-species approach should be adopted for pest animal control.
Cat control
Large-scale control of feral cats is very difficult, particularly on the  mainland, although some programs have
been successful on islands
. The use of poison baits can reduce cat density, but even low levels of cat predation can exterminate threatened mammal
populations
, such as when cats killed at least seven bilbies reintroduced outside the Arid Recovery reserve in South Australia.
Predator-free islands and fenced reserves on the mainland are the most effective short-term protection for our threatened mammals. However, fences that exclude predators are very expensive to build, and they require constant monitoring, maintenance and funding.
Non-lethal methods have traditionally been overlooked in the fight against invasive predators, such as the feral cat. However,
new research
suggests that smart fire and grazing management can help preserve the natural shelters that provide native animals with refuge from predators.
Reducing the impact of feral cats on our native animals is a challenging endeavour, but it is essential in the fight to conserve our unique fauna."
"Jury still out on whether cats are killers, but prison is on the cards",https://theconversation.com/jury-still-out-on-whether-cats-are-killers-but-prison-is-on-the-cards-4913,"In “
The Tragedy of Pudd’nhead Wilson
”, Mark Twain equated keeping a cat to domestic bliss:
When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there – in sunny weather – stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat – and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered cat – may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?
But not all pet cats sleep innocently in the sun all day. Many are accomplished hunters at some point in their lives. The cumulative effect of their occasional hunting is substantial wildlife mortality.
By bringing their prey home, cats make their hunting behaviour easier to research.
Cult Gigolo/Flickr
Cats are renowned for bringing their prey home to their owners. Researchers have exploited this habit, using it to calculate predation mortality in local communities. By extrapolating the results, they calculated mortalities at a national level. These rough estimates suggest that pet cats kill 29.2 million birds and 57.4 million mammals annually in the UK, and 100 million birds annually in the USA.
In Australia, the type and number of prey taken vary with location. In warmer climates lizards are common prey, while elsewhere mammals and birds predominate. In large urban centres the prey are mainly introduced species such as house mice, starlings and sparrows, but rural cats or those with access to native bushland catch more native species.
Many people in the community are concerned and want to regulate cat ownership to reduce wildlife deaths. Others argue that mortality estimates are inflated or that pet cats take prey that would otherwise have died of other causes, deflecting attention from more serious causes of wildlife decline, especially habitat destruction.
In warmer climates, lizards are common prey.

Proponents of cat regulation point to the increasing importance of urban environments for wildlife conservation and the need to reduce mortality of the wildlife they contain. In the highly urbanised UK, for example, domestic gardens cover a greater area than the country’s wildlife reserves. They include around a quarter of all the trees outside woodlands.
In Australia, gardens and bushland reserves in built-up areas are important habitat for threatened species susceptible to cat predation; these include the legless lizard
Delma impar
, in suburban Canberra, and the
eastern barred bandicoot
in Hamilton, Victoria.
However, it is also true that pet cats generally take common vertebrates, and these persist in cities despite predation (although more serious problems may arise near remnant native vegetation and on urban fringes). Furthermore, studies attributing wildlife population declines to pet cats also identify larger mortalities from other factors such as road traffic, or acknowledge that cat predation may be removing animals that would otherwise perish from different causes. There is also the possibility that pet cats hold rodents in check, preventing them from preying on bird eggs and nestlings.
Cats may kill species that threaten other species.

To further complicate interpretation, wildlife may respond differently to pet cats in different localities. For example, there is concern about declines in starlings in the UK because of heavy predation by pet cats, whereas in eastern Australia starlings thrive despite being common prey of pet cats.
Regardless of the controversy, owners who wish to reduce predation by their cats have plenty of options. Collar-worn predation deterrents may be the solution for free-roaming pet cats. They include the old staple of a bell on the collar, electronic devices that chime at short intervals or when a cat pounces, coloured ruffs around the collar that warn birds away and flaps of material called pounce protectors that interfere with paw-eye coordination when the cat pounces.
Despite scepticism from some owners, controlled experiments demonstrate that many of these devices work. They don’t always stop an individual cat from hunting altogether, but they often reduce the number of prey captured.
Pounce protectors may not stop a cat hunting, but they reduce its success.

Confining cats at night reduces predation on nocturnal fauna, although birds and many lizards are vulnerable by day. Day-time curfews may be a solution for owners concerned about native birds and reptiles, especially if they live in areas where the only local small mammals are introduced ones like mice and rats.
Keeping cats confined at all times protects all fauna, but is unpopular with owners. Nevertheless, it protects cats from the serious risks of road accidents and fighting injuries that are major causes of cat illness and death.
We await definitive experiments that will tell us if predation by pet cats reduces wildlife populations. But we believe that the increasing importance of urban environments for wildlife conservation and the undeniable fact that many pet cats hunt warrants precautionary action. Owners can use predation deterrents or consider partial or total confinement of their cats."
What actually is catnip and is it safe for my cat?,https://theconversation.com/what-actually-is-catnip-and-is-it-safe-for-my-cat-160961,"There are many valid theories to explain the global appeal of
cats
, including our obsession with watching videos of them online. In terms of cats’ pure entertainment value, however, our fascinations are probably attributable to their seemingly endless repertoire of bizarre behaviours.
From being able to “trap” your cat by simply
drawing a square around them
, to cats seemingly freaking out when presented with a cucumber (I don’t condone this latter activity on cat welfare grounds), our feline companions are as entertaining as they are perplexing.
When it comes to their seemingly weird reactions to things, their response to an unassuming plant belonging to the mint family is no exception.
Nepeta cataria
, or more commonly known as catnip is a plant native to parts of Europe and Asia that
is well known
for its cat-attracting (and craze-inducing) properties among domestic cats and several other (non-domesticated) felids, including lions, leopards and jaguars. Responses to catnip typically include sniffing, licking, biting, rubbing or rolling on the plant, head shaking, drooling, vocalising and even kicking with the hind feet.
Catnip’s status as kitty kryptonite is due to a specific chemical compound called nepalacatlone that the plant naturally releases when its leaves or stem are bruised. This chemical is thought to bind to protein receptors within the cat’s nose which then stimulate sensory neurons that lead to changes in brain activity.
These mind-altering affects can typically last between five and 15 minutes, although some cats will respond much more intensely and for longer than others. Interestingly, the ability to respond to catnip is thought
to be heritable
, with around
one in three adult cats
seemingly immune to its effect.
However, other scientists argue all cats may possess the ability to react to catnip, but that some are active and others more passive responders, with differences in intensities of reactions influenced by their
age, sex and neuter status
.
Is catnip a drug for cats?
Many cats are certainly very attracted to catnip and will actively seek it out in their environment. For these reasons, catnip is often used (in its dried form) to encourage cats to use their scratching posts – as opposed to the arm of our expensive new sofa. It’s also commonly placed within cat toys or planted in gardens as a
source of enrichment
for cats.
In humans, smoking catnip has been described as inducing sensations akin to those of
marijuana or LSD
. It’s possible that cats
may experience similar
effects, although their brains are not quite the same as ours, so their “trips” might feel a little different to them.

Is it unethical to give your cat catnip?
However,
a recent study
indicates that exposure of cats to nepalactalone leads to increases in a peptide hormone associated with pleasure. This suggests that catnip could have some pretty powerful feel-good properties for kitties.
Interestingly, the authors also found that cats covered in nepalactalol were less likely to be bothered by mosquitoes. This provides a suitable evolutionary explanation for cats’ innate attraction (and reaction) to the plant - covering yourself in catnip might feel really good, but also help keep those pesky insects at bay.
Around a third of cats are immune to catnip’s effects.

Is it cruel to give a cat catnip?
Although evidence suggests catnip does have pleasurable side-effects, not everything we like – or are at least attracted to – is good for us. The heightened arousal and altered state of consciousness that probably occurs among active responders may not always be a welcome experience.
In situations where cats feel anxious, unsure or not fully in control, they tend to seek out sources of
safety rather than stimulation
. Under these circumstances, the last thing cats probably want is to go on some sort of mind-bending hallucinogenic trip.
While it may certainly be fun for us to watch their catnip-induced antics, we should think carefully about if we are doing this for the cats’ benefit, or simply for our entertainment. We should also avoid disturbing or trying to stroke cats that are under the influence, and ultimately, cats should always
be allowed to say no
.
If we want to give cats catnip, it’s best that we place it somewhere quiet, away from their core areas in the home – avoid locations where they usually eat and sleep – and let them decide if they feel like taking a hit, in their own time."
Cats in the middle ages: what medieval manuscripts teach us about our ancestors’ pets,https://theconversation.com/cats-in-the-middle-ages-what-medieval-manuscripts-teach-us-about-our-ancestors-pets-195389,"Cats had a
bad reputation
in the middle ages. Their presumed links with paganism and
witchcraft
meant they were often treated with suspicion. But despite their association with the supernatural, medieval manuscripts showcase surprisingly playful images of our furry friends.
From these (often very funny) portrayals, we can learn a lot about medieval attitudes towards cats – not least that they were a central fixture of daily medieval life.
In the middle ages, men and women were
often identified
by the animals they kept.
Pet monkeys
, for example, were considered exotic and a sign that the owner was wealthy, because they had been imported from distant lands. Pets became part of the personal identity of the nobility. Keeping an animal that was lavished with attention, affection and high-quality food in return for no functional purpose – other than companionship – signified high status.
It was not unusual for high-status men and women in the middle ages to have their portrait completed
in the company of a pet
, most commonly cats and dogs, to signify their elevated status.
Last Supper (1320), by Pietro Lorenzetti.
Web Gallery of Art
It is commonplace to see images of cats in
iconography of feasts
and other domestic spaces, which appears to reflect their status as a pet in the medieval household.
In Pietro Lorenzetti’s Last Supper (above), a cat sits by the fire while a small dog licks a plate of leftovers on the ground. The cat and dog play no narrative role in the scene, but instead signal to the viewer that this is a domestic space.
Similarly, in the miniature of
a Dutch Book of Hours
(a common type of prayer book in the middle ages that marked the divisions of the day with specific prayers), a man and woman feature in a cosy household scene while a well looked-after cat gazes on from the bottom left-hand corner. Again, the cat is not the centre of the image nor the focus of the composition, but it is accepted in this medieval domestic space.

Just like today, medieval families gave their
cats names
. A 13th-century cat in Beaulieu Abbey, for example,
was called “Mite”
according to the green ink lettering that appears above a doodle of said cat in the margins of a medieval manuscript.
Royal treatment
Cats were
well cared for
in the medieval household. In the early 13th century, there is
mention in the accounts
for the manor at Cuxham (Oxfordshire) of cheese being bought for a cat, which suggests that they were not left to fend for themselves.
Bacchiacca (circa 1525), by the Italian painter Antonio d'Ubertino Verdi.
Christie’s
In fact, the 14th-century queen of France,
Isabeau of Bavaria
, spent excessive amounts of money on accessories for her pets. In 1387, she commissioned a collar embroidered with pearls and fastened by a gold buckle for her pet squirrel. In 1406, bright green cloth was bought to make a special cover for her cat.
Cats were also
common companions
for
scholars
, and eulogies about cats were not uncommon in the 16th century. In one poem, a cat is described as a scholar’s light and dearest companion. Eulogies such as this suggest a strong emotional attachment to pet cats, and show how cats not only cheered up their masters but provided welcome distractions from the hard mental craft of reading and writing.
Cats in the cloisters
Cats are found in abundance as a
status symbol
in medieval religious spaces. There are lots of medieval manuscripts that feature, for example, illuminations (small images) of nuns with cats, and cats frequently appear as doodles in the margins of Books of Hours.

But there is also much criticism about the keeping of cats in medieval sermon literature. The 14th-century English preacher
John Bromyard
considered them useless and overfed accessories of the rich that benefited while the poor went hungry.

Cats are
also recorded
as being associated with the devil. Their stealth and cunning when hunting for mice was admired – but this did not always translate into qualities desirable for companionship. These associations led to the killing of some cats, which had detrimental effects during the
Black Death
and other middle age plagues, when more cats may have reduced flea-infested rat populations.
Because of these associations, many thought that cats had
no place
in the sacred spaces of religious orders. There do not seem to have been any formal rules, however, stating that members of religious communities were not allowed to keep cats – and the constant criticism of the practice perhaps suggests that pet cats were common.

Even if they were not always considered as socially acceptable in religious communities, cats were still clearly
well looked after
. This is evident in the playful images we see of them in monasteries.
For the most part, cats were quite at home in the medieval household. And as their playful depiction in many medieval manuscripts and artwork makes clear, our medieval ancestors’ relationships with these animals were not too different from our own."
Five things to consider before getting a feline companion,https://theconversation.com/five-things-to-consider-before-getting-a-feline-companion-177267,"In the words of Sigmund Freud, “time spent with cats is never wasted.” It’s a view that’s shared by the millions of people across the globe who are drawn to the small felines who chose to live with humans
thousands of years
ago.
With remarkable anatomical, physiological and
behavioural similarities
to their wild big cat cousins, it’s their independent yet mellow nature (not to mention cuteness) that makes cats such a
popular pet
, especially in the western world.
But people often underestimate what caring for a cat entails. Here are some of the important things to think about before welcoming a feline into your home.
Early socialisation
Cats need
extensive socialisation
to ensure they can thrive as a pet and form a close relationship with their humans. Habituation to people and other animals – as well as to different sounds, objects and physical contact – has to be done by the age of
seven or eight weeks
. This places a huge responsibility on cat breeders and cat shelters, as kittens must not be taken from their mother until at least
eight weeks old
(ideally ten to 12). During this time they build up their strength and immunity from feeding on their mother’s milk, and learn to play and use their litter tray under her guidance.
Check that the kitten is still with its mum before you agree to adopt or buy, and that they have reached the appropriate age before you take them home.
Training and stimulation
Cats are independent animals and like to do what they want, when they want. So, you will need to teach them not to jump up onto kitchen surfaces and any other places where they might not be welcome. This is best done when they are young but adult cats can also be trained to
some degree too
. If you invest the time, you will make your own life easier and your cat’s life happier.

Physics and psychology of cats – an (improbable) conversation
Generally speaking most cats are perfectly content in their own company for several hours a day. But just as with dogs there are some cats who suffer from
separation-related anxiety
, which can lead to behaviours such as
inappropriate urination
or an unusual level of vocalisation.
Cats and dogs can be best pals and keep each other company.

If you are going to be away for long periods of time every day then you will need to make sure they have stimulation. You might consider getting two cats from the same litter, rather than one. Or a cat flap. Or maybe even a dog. Cats and dogs can form close bonds, but you’ll need to be careful about how you introduce your cat to a new canine friend – here also, socialisation at an early age is key.
Nutritional and medical needs
Cats are supreme and opportunistic hunters, which can lead to pressure on their
prey species
, as well as on you as an owner to prevent such killings.
Be prepared to put some effort into finding a cat food which meets their approval as cats can be very picky eaters. You may even want to consider the type of bowl you feed them from as cats sometimes suffer from
whisker stress
.
You will need to have them microchipped at a young age and vaccinated annually – and the choice and optimal time to neuter will require some
thinking through
.
A suitable environment
Be sure that you can provide a living environment that suits your cat’s character.
Cats are considered a
semi-solitary animal
. They can benefit from being adopted with a same-sex animal from the same litter. But if you already have an older cat that is used to a quiet life, you may
cause considerable upset
by adopting a new little kitten or bringing in another adult cat.
Cats enjoy human company but like to choose who they mix with.

Cats are highly agile and live three dimensionally, which means that they like to sit in high places, jump and climb. They also inhabit an olfactory world, which may come with a need to
encounter interesting smells
. Be prepared to adapt your home accordingly, as these are important behavioural needs and they cannot be persuaded not to do them.

How to stroke a cat, according to science
To prevent your sofa from becoming the scratch pole, you’ll probably want to provide your cat with scratching poles. Make sure that they are long enough to allow a full body stretch, and placed at central positions in
your home
.
Pedigree or rescue
Adopting a cat from a rescue centre can be an incredibly rewarding experience – and can also make it easier to find a cat that is a perfect match.
Choose the cat for its character, not just its looks. Individuals differ widely in
personality and temperament
, including friendliness, boldness and likelihood of aggression. It’s important to find the cat or kitten who fits perfectly with you and your living conditions.
If you opt for a pedigree kitten, find a breeder that invests heavily in socialising the kittens.
Choose your breed
carefully as they have very different characteristics – some are more lazy and mellow, others more vocal and demanding. Be aware though, that some breeds may be prone to
hereditary issues
that can cause serious health issues.
Last but not least comes the fun part of deciding what to call your new kitten (an older rescue cat will probably have a name already). Cats learn their name very quickly – just make sure you choose something you’re happy to shout out loud when calling your feline friend in for the night."
"Can your pets get coronavirus, and can you catch it from them?",https://theconversation.com/can-your-pets-get-coronavirus-and-can-you-catch-it-from-them-135611,"Humans and animals share many diseases. And as dramatically shown by the
tigers that tested positive
in the Bronx Zoo, the coronavirus is one of them. As
three
veterinary
epidemiologists
who study infectious disease, we have been asked a lot questions about if and how the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 affects pets.
Can my pet get the coronavirus?
When talking about a virus, the words “get” or “catch” are vague. A more precise question is: Can my cat or dog become infected with SARS-CoV-2?
The answer is yes. There is evidence from real-world cases as well as laboratory experiments that both cats and dogs can become infected with coronavirus.
In Hong Kong, health officials have tested 17 dogs and eight cats living with COVID-19 patients
for the coronavirus
. They found evidence of the virus in two dogs:
a Pomeranian
and a
German shepherd
, though neither became sick.
None of the eight cats were infected or had been sick. However, there is a
separate report
of an infected cat from Hong Kong.
Another case of an infected cat
was reported in Belgium
. Again, the owner of the cat had COVID-19, but unlike the infected cat in Hong Kong, this one had become sick with respiratory problems as well as diarrhea and vomiting.
The final evidence comes from Wuhan, where researchers tested 102 cats and released
a pre-print study
of the results. Fifteen of those cats tested positive for the antibodies to the virus – meaning the cats been exposed in the past. As the researchers say in the paper, the coronavirus has “infected cat populations in Wuhan, implying that this risk could also occur at other outbreak regions.” This study tested cats from owners with COVID-19, veterinary hospitals and even some strays. Three of the infected cats were owned by COVID-19-affected patients which explains their exposure; for the other 12 it is unclear how they were infected.
Cat-masks, though stylish, are unnecessary.

Can my pet spread the virus to another animal?
If cats or dogs can spread the coronavirus, health agencies and the public would need to incorporate these animals into their planning to contain and slow the pandemic. It is very important to know how easily the coronavirus replicates in pets and whether they can transfer it to other animals. A group of researchers in China set out to answer these questions.
To do this, they inoculated – that is, directly exposed – a number of cats and dogs with the coronavirus by deliberately placing large doses of live SARS-CoV-2 into their noses. The scientists then put some of these inoculated animals next to uninfected control animals to see if the exposed animals got sick, could spread the virus to the uninfected animals, or both.
The researchers found that
kittens and adolescent cats can become infected
when given a large dose of the virus. All five of the kittens who were inoculated became sick and two died, but all of the adolescent cats were able to fight off the infection without becoming seriously ill.
They also found that
cats can spread the coronavirus to other cats
. After a week, one-third of the uninfected cats that were placed next to the inoculated cats tested positive for the coronavirus.
These results provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in cats and can make them sick. It also shows that cats can transfer the virus through the air to other cats.
The same researchers also
looked at dogs
and found them to be much more resistant to the virus and unable to transmit it to other animals.
This is important information, but the conditions of the experiment were very unnatural. There are no studies about transmission of the virus between cats and dogs in the real world so it remains unclear whether natural transmission is occurring. While this experiment shows that cats and dogs are not totally immune to the coronavirus, the lack of a pandemic among household pets provides some evidence that they are more resistant than people are.
Though cats can become infected, evidence suggests it is extremely unlikely they could pass it on to humans.

Can I get the coronavirus from my cat?
While we can’t say it would be impossible to catch the coronavirus from a cat or dog, the research suggests this is extremely unlikely. There are currently no reported cases of people catching the coronavirus from animals.
The
World Health Organization says that
“based on current evidence, human to human transmission remains the main driver” of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that “further evidence is needed to understand if animals and pets can spread the disease.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that
there is no evidence pets can spread COVID-19 to people
.
While your cat can get infected, according to the science, it is extremely unlikely they could pass it to you. In fact, if your cat is infected, the chances are your cat caught the coronavirus from you.
Just to be safe, your pets should follow the same social distancing rules as everyone else.

Should I keep my cat inside or change my dog’s behavior?
Although the chances of your pet catching the coronavirus from another animal are low, if you take your dog or cat outside, have your pets follow the same rules as everyone else – keep them away from other people and animals.
If a dog approaches you, there is no need to be scared of
getting sick from virus on the dog’s fur
. But avoid approaching dogs on leashes – not because of the dog, but because there is usually a human on the other end.
If you become ill with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that you
isolate yourself from your pets
and have someone else care for them. If that isn’t possible, continue to wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face.
Also remember: If your pet needs medical care, make sure you inform your veterinarian if you or a household member is ill with COVID-19. That information will allow your veterinarian to take adequate precautions.
The evidence around pets and the coronavirus is changing rapidly and our team is keeping an updated review about how
cats, dogs, ferrets, other less common pets and livestock
are affected by the new coronavirus. But where the science stands today, there is little to worry about with regards to your cat or dog. In rare cases, they might become infected with the virus, but the chances of them getting sick from the infection or passing it on to you or another animal are extremely low.

Cool for cats: that spiny tongue does more than keep a cat well groomed,https://theconversation.com/cool-for-cats-that-spiny-tongue-does-more-than-keep-a-cat-well-groomed-107007,"Have you ever been licked by a cat? If so you’ll know the feline tongue feels more like sandpaper than satin.
A cat’s tongue is covered in hundreds of sharp, scoop-shaped spines made of keratin that spring into action during grooming. Until now we haven’t really known why their tongues are so rough.
But new research,
published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
, shows they play a role in helping a cat keep cool.
Cat grooming
Domestic cats spend up to a quarter of their waking time grooming their fur coat to help remove pesky fleas and loose hairs. If they didn’t groom, then any excess debris could tangle fur, causing painful tugging of the skin, and even lead to infection.

Senate inquiry calls for tougher rules on pet food in Australia
But the new study reports something else that happens when a cat uses its tongue for grooming.
The scientists used CT scans of cat tongues to work out the structure of the spines, known as papillae. The spines are about 2mm long and have a U-shaped cavity at their tip (more on why later). The researchers also measured the hardness of the papillae, and found it is similar to that of human fingernails.
This is the surface of a cat’s tongue. Rigid, hollow papillae near the tongue tip are shown on the right, while soft, conical papillae near the throat are shown to the left.
Alexis Noel
It got more interesting when the scientists used high-speed videography to work out what happens to the spines when a cat is grooming. Only the spines at the end of the tongue contact the fur during grooming. These are larger and not as closely packed as the spines nearer the bottom of the tongue.
A slice of a cat tongue, displaying papillae embedded in tissue.

As a cat grooms, there are four steps. First the tongue is extended out of the mouth. Then the muscles in the tongue expand the surface, and the spines rotate to become perpendicular to the tongue.
In the final two steps the tongue sweeps through the fur and is taken back into the mouth with a U-shaped curl.
This is a black cat grooming its fur, displaying the papillae on the tongue.
Using some fake fur and a force plate, the scientists calculated that with the amount of compression of the tongue on the fur, the spines can actually contact the skin of the cat.
This is where it gets even more interesting – and also a bit icky, as we need to think about cat saliva.
The saliva action
The U-shaped cavity in the tip of the spines, which we mentioned earlier, acts as a wick in the mouth to take up saliva. This is the same action as when you put the tip of a tissue in water and the water creeps up the tissue.
Because scientists like to work out the detail, they calculated that these cavities would take up around 4μL (microlitres) of saliva across 290 spines. (It would take around 1,200 times this amount of saliva to fill a 5ml metric teaspoon.)
This 4μl is only around 5% of the total saliva on the surface of the cat’s tongue. Not much, but it has a really important function as it can deposit saliva right down to a cat’s skin.
The scientists used the estimate that cats spend around a quarter of their time awake grooming (about 2.4 hours a day) and lick about once per second.
This means cats can lose around a quarter of the total heat they need to lose per day through the tiny bit of saliva in their tongue spines. (We lose heat through liquid by sweating when we’re hot.)
Cool for cats
Many (not all) cats live in hot climates, so this would be really important for their survival. The researchers looked at the tongues of several species of cat, including domestic cat, bobcat, cougar, snow leopard, tiger and lion.
Most cats groom themselves very effectively, helped by enzymes (special chemicals) in their saliva that dissolve blood and other debris.
By working out how far the spines penetrate cat fur, and measuring the length of fur in different breeds, the scientists also worked out the only cats that can’t groom themselves effectively are domestic Persians, which are typically long-haired.

Chocolate Labradors die earlier than yellow or black, and have more disease
This means if you own a Persian you need to take the time to brush them, or else matts form and can damage their skin and lead to infections. But here’s where the scientists made another breakthrough.
A new brush
In the final part of this research, the scientists used the knowledge they gained about the spiny form of a cat’s tongue, and used 3D printing to develop a better grooming brush to use on cats.
The prototype grooming tool allows easy removal of hair after grooming.
The scientists say the biology-inspired brush should help remove allergens from cat fur, and help with the application of any cleaning lotions and medications on cats’ skin.
The brush design may also help inspire news ways to clean other complex hairy surfaces.
So next time you watch a cat grooming, take a moment to marvel at just how much awesome science is involved in the evolutionary design of its tongue."
"Ginger, tortie, calico – the mystery gene responsible for orange colour in cat coats has been found",https://theconversation.com/ginger-tortie-calico-the-mystery-gene-responsible-for-orange-colour-in-cat-coats-has-been-found-244934,"Orange and tortoiseshell house cats (torties) have long been an enigma for hair coloration in mammals: now, the genetic basis of their distinctive coat colour has been unveiled.
Orange is an ancient colour variety. Ginger cats are evident in Egyptian tomb artworks and
some mummified cats may have been gingers
. From
Garfield
and
Puss in Boots
to Hermione Granger’s
Crookshanks
and
Goose the Flerken
in the Marvel universe, ginger (or orange) cats are everywhere in popular culture today.
Orange isn’t the most typical coat colour in cats. Most cats are non-orange, usually brown or grey tabbies with some pattern of black stripes, swirls or spots, or black or blue solid-coloured cats.
Tortoiseshell cats have a brindling pattern (mixture) of orange and non-orange hairs throughout the coat, with some areas mostly orange or non-orange. Calico cats have distinct patches of orange and non-orange, in addition to extensive regions of white. Gingers are mostly male, while tortoiseshells are typically female.
Now, after more than 110 years, two
new
studies
finally reveal the gene and the variant for orange coat colour.

A visionary theory
In 1912, before the
XX/XY sex-determining system
was discovered in cats, American geneticist Clarence Cook Little proposed a
visionary theory
to explain how cats inherit orange and non-orange coat colours.
He built on the idea of a “sex-producing factor”, symbolised as X, that was gaining acceptance at that time (mainly from work on sex-determination in insects). He proposed:
let’s suppose female cats have two copies (XX) of the sex-producing factor X, while male cats have just one copy (X—)
let’s also suppose there is
something
associated with the sex-producing factor X that affects coat colour and exists in two forms: normal (the non-orange form) and variant (the orange form).
This theory predicts that tortoiseshell cats have one of each form of the X factor, in which case they must be XX, and therefore must be female. Because males have only one X factor, they will be either orange or non-orange, but never tortoiseshell.
Little’s theory also explains the common observation that ginger cats are mostly male. If matings are not arranged on the basis of coat colour, and if we assume, for example, that 20% of male cats are ginger (having just one X factor of the orange form), the proportion of female ginger cats is expected to be much lower, as they need to receive two copies of the orange X factor.
Mathematically this can be calculated as 20% x 20% = 4%, meaning that we would expect only 4% of female cats to be orange.
Eventually, the X factor was revealed as the
X chromosome
, and the “—” as the
Y chromosome
.
Tortoiseshell and calico males do sometimes occur, but it’s usually due to an abnormality of the number of sex chromosomes, such as one too many X chromosomes (XXY), which also causes sterility.
Calico cats have white in their coats in addition to patches of orange and non-orange.

Modern science confirms Little’s visionary theory
Little’s set of assumptions gave rise to predictions that have actually worked in practice for more than 110 years. This is a great example of the power and utility of what might have initially appeared to be an extraordinary theory.
The newly posted, not yet peer-reviewed reports of independent discoveries by a
Japanese team
and an
American team
have now found the
something
that Little proposed to be associated with the sex-producing factor X.
It’s a
gene
that’s part of the X chromosome. It produces a protein whose name is a bit of a mouthful: RHO GTPase-Activating Protein 36. The official gene symbol
ARHGAP36
is not very descriptive, so we will simply call it the Orange gene.
The Orange gene has a known role in hair follicle development, but scientists didn’t previously know it is also involved in pigment production. This means that a new pathway for pigment production has been discovered, opening the way for exciting and important research into a basic biological process.
Ginger cats are mostly male.

A curious bit of deleted DNA
The other important discovery by these research teams is that the orange form proposed by Little is a large
DNA deletion
(loss of genetic material) of part of the Orange gene, and the non-orange form is the unchanged or “
wild-type
” version of that same gene.
While the deletion does not appear to change the protein that is produced by the gene, it does seem to impact when and where the protein is produced. Both discovery teams showed the Orange gene is persistently switched on in orange areas but is mostly switched off in non-orange areas of a cat’s coat.
Even though much remains to be discovered, ginger cats and their owners around the world can rejoice – the genetic basis of their distinctive coat colour has finally been worked out, more than 110 years after it was first proposed."
Study shows thepaw-sitiveeffects of watching cat videos,https://theconversation.com/study-shows-the-paw-sitive-effects-of-watching-cat-videos-43454,"According to
ReelSEO.com
, a website about video marketing, there are more than two million cat videos on YouTube. People have watched these videos more than 25 billion times, which equates to
an average of 12,000 views per cat video
.
The statistics speak for themselves, but they don’t tell the whole story.
Perhaps it’s because I’m a dog lover with a cat allergy, but the staggering amount of cat media available to internet users came as a surprise to me. With numbers like that, I couldn’t help but wonder: who, exactly, is so drawn to this type of content? And what effects do cat-related media have on viewers?
The keyboard cat video has been viewed over 40 million times on YouTube.
These were the overarching question that spurred my initial quest to gather empirical data on the internet cat phenomenon. I scoured academic databases to see what the literature could tell me, but found no existing data about
why
people watched so many cat videos online, or what effects these videos might have on us.
So I decided to find out myself.
My neighborhood internet celebrity feline – the adorable
Lil Bub
, who happens to also live in Bloomington, Indiana – shared the link on her website after I launched an online survey. With Bub’s help, the survey quickly garnered nearly 7,000 respondents.
The results from this exploratory
study
suggest that certain people are, in fact, more likely than others to view copious amounts of internet cat videos. It also showed that cat videos can positively influence the emotions of viewers.
According to my study, if you currently own or have previously owned a cat – or if you’ve volunteered to assist pets in the past year – you’re more likely to watch cat videos. Cat video viewers also spent more time online than other participants, tended to be more agreeable and shy, and felt they had adequate emotional support in their lives. However, emotional stability was negatively (albeit only slightly) related to watching online cat-related media.
The data also revealed information about the nature of audience interactions with online cat media. Three-quarters of respondents did not actively seek out cat content. Instead, they happened upon it in the course of their daily internet use.
This means that it’s hard to avoid internet cats, even if you want to.
It’s tough to avoid encountering internet cat celebrities like Lil Bub.
Still, online cat videos aren’t all about passive consumption. Many people indicated they also produce their own cat-related media to post online, which often amass comments and likes. Online cat-media consumption is therefore an interactive process where media consumers can be media producers and media critics, all in the same space.
But I really wanted to learn what effects watching online cat videos might have on viewers.
People in my study reported experiencing more positive emotions and having higher energy levels after watching cat videos than before. They also reported lower levels of negative emotions after viewing online cat-related content.
In short, most of us get a little psychological “pick-me-up” when we watch Lil Bub climb the stairs or view a hilarious Grumpy Cat meme.
You might wonder: So what? Why does this study matter beyond its momentary entertainment value?
Well, we now spend more time with media than ever before. If – as my study suggests – part of that media diet includes cute pet videos, then it’s important to know how that specific genre impacts us psychologically if we want to truly understand the role of media use in shaping who we are.
Second, media is often criticized (sometimes rightfully so) for harming society – for making us
violent
,
confused about science
or even
narcissistic
. This study, though, indicates that media use can have a beneficial impact. Even a short-lived boost in one’s mood may help someone make it through a day or charge through an unpleasant task.
A distraction, or a mood-enhancer?
Because this study was an exploratory attempt to quantify an anecdotally popular activity, I don’t think it should be the final word on the role of pet-related media in our lives. Instead, it should be a springboard for more research.
Experiments that use control groups can test different types of cat videos (eg, humorous, cute, or inspirational) for differences in emotional reactions. Additionally, researchers could test if digitized cats or dogs can serve as a low-cost form of pet therapy for those who are allergic to real pets.
Cat videos are here to stay, so I hope researchers continue to study the potential “paw-sitive” effects of this type of media."
"To eradicate feral cats, we need to know how many are out there",https://theconversation.com/to-eradicate-feral-cats-we-need-to-know-how-many-are-out-there-33014,"During a
speech in Parliament
on October 17 1996 — 18 years ago today — then Liberal MP Richard Evans called for the “total eradication of domestic and feral cats from the Australian mainland and offshore islands by the year 2020”.
Similarly, Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt last week
announced
a 10-year plan to eradicate “all of the significant populations of feral cats around Australia”.
There has also been a lot of media recently about feral cats in Australia, including:
Radio National’s Background Briefing
,
ABC Online
,
the Sydney Morning Herald
,
Radio National’s Bush Telegraph
and
The Australian
It’s great that the national conversation is gaining momentum on this issue. Australia has lost 30 mammal species to extinction in just over 200 years, which is the worst mammal extinction record anywhere in the world. According to Professor
John Woinarski
at Charles Darwin University, at least 20 of these
can be attributed to cats
.
A recent wave of
mammal declines
in parts of northern Australia, such as Kakadu National Park, has sparked a renewed call for action on feral cats.
But how many cats are out there? If we look at the evidence, we really don’t know.
Feral cats are found right across Australia.
Invasive animals CRC
Twisted tales
The media around this topic often quotes a feral cat population estimate that their followers can grab onto. I’m even guilty of it
myself
.
The SMH article above quotes the Australian Wildlife Conservancy (AWC) in saying there are an estimated 15 million feral cats in Australia and the Background Briefing report says there are an estimated 15 to 23 million cats.
AWC says that cats eat between
five and 30 native animals a night
and then they multiply this figure of five by 15 million cats to estimate that feral cats eat 75 million native animals each night.
Similarly, in a
follow up
to the Background Briefing report, the ABC’s Gregg Borschmann is quoted as saying “Did you know there’s 20 million of them out there, and every one of them eats five critters a night. That’s 20 billion native animals a year” (although my calculations make this closer to 40 billion).
The assumption that cats eat five native animals each night may hold true in northern Australia where European rabbits are largely absent, but it won’t always stand up in the southern half of the continent where rabbits form a staple part of cats’ diets in many areas. These are only estimates of course and they’re useful for engaging the wider community in the feral cat discussion.
A number of news reports also state that the recent
Action Plan for Australian Mammals
estimated that there are 15 million feral cats in Australia. I’ve read the main sections of this 1,000 page book, and I don’t believe this to be the case. It appears that these numbers are becoming conflated as they filter through various media reports.
Nevertheless, these massive numbers are great for capturing the attention of the general public and raising awareness about feral cat impacts. But from a scientific point of view, it’s important to ask how reliable these estimates are.
What do scientists say?
Professor David Pimentel and colleagues at Cornell University in
2001
quoted a figure of 18 million feral cats in Australia, with the reference being an anonymous 1996 New Zealand newspaper article.
Then in 2004 a
Pest Animal Control CRC report
cited Pimentel for the figure of 18 million cats and in 2008 the Commonwealth
Threat Abatement Plan
for predation by feral cats cited the 2004 report also for the figure of 18 million.
In their
2010 report
, Dr Elizabeth Denny and Professor Chris Dickman stated the following: ""Pimentel et al (2001) estimated that there are approximately 18 million feral cats in Australia, although the accuracy of this estimation is unknown"".
The series of reports detailed above are all relying on a single citation of an anonymous 1996 New Zealand newspaper article.
The newspaper article in question takes its figure of 18 million from the same Parliament speech by MP Richard Evans on October 17 1996 that called for the eradication of feral cats. Evans also quoted figures of 5 and 12 million, but took the figure of 18 million from a
1993 NSW Parliament speech
by then state Labor MP Bob Martin where he stated “Wildlife experts state that between 5.6 million and 18.4 million of these animals are roaming Australia”.
A number of sources incorrectly cite
a 1991 report
for those figures, which seem to have come from
this 1993 pamphlet
. In turn, the pamphlet doesn’t say where it took its numbers from. Wherever they came from, these figures seem to be the best estimate we have.

Tim Doherty/ECU
Where to from here?
Calculating an absolute number of feral cats in Australia is a very difficult exercise. Australia is a vast and diverse continent, both spatially and temporally.
Estimates of cat population densities range from 0.03 to 4.7 cats per square kilometre in relatively unmodified and pastoral landscapes, and from 0.7 to 800 cats per square kilometre in highly modified landscapes, such as rubbish dumps.
Extrapolating these figures across the entire continent would yield some fairly wide confidence intervals. Taking a conservative estimate of 1 cat per square kilometre across the entire continent  would amount to nearly 8 million cats.
But calculating a more reliable estimate would involve using different density estimates for different climatic regions and would also need to consider inter-annual variation caused by rainfall.
I haven’t attempted to do this, nor do I seek to put forward a better estimate here. However, I think it’s important that we think about this more closely, especially given Greg Hunt’s decade-long feral cat eradication plan. How can we eradicate feral cats if we don’t know how many there are?

"Ferals, strays, pets: how to control the cats that are eating our wildlife",https://theconversation.com/ferals-strays-pets-how-to-control-the-cats-that-are-eating-our-wildlife-31182,"Feral domestic cats are a global threat to biodiversity and were
recently named
as the biggest threat to endangered Australian mammals.
But what about your pet cat, or the local stray? While any kind of domestic cat can kill wildlife, there’s no “one size fits all” way to manage their impact.
Before we figure out how best to manage cats, we first need to distinguish between the different categories.
What’s in a name?
There are likely more than 10 million feral cats in Australia, and each year
tens of thousands
of stray cats are put down in Australian cities.
Feral cats in Australia (Invasive Animals CRC)
But there are several ways to classify cats. They include: pet cat, house cat, domestic cat, stray, feral, semi-feral, unowned, colony cat and free-roaming, amongst others.
Despite the plethora of systems, we can make a couple of generalisations. Common characteristics that are used in defining different groups of cats include their degree of socialisation, ancestry, ownership, fear of humans and reliance on humans for their care.
The broadest two groups that can be identified are “owned” cats, which live in a household where they are fed and cared for by humans, and “unowned” cats that do not live in a household and may or may not be fed or cared for. The term “free-roaming”, on the other hand, can include both owned and unowned cats, since it generally refers to a lack of confinement.
Both owned and unowned cats can kill wildlife, so the term free-roaming is useful for management in cities where both groups co-exist.
Stray or semi-feral cats are those that were once owned and part of a household but have since become lost or dumped by their owners. Stray cats are partly or wholly dependent on humans for the provision of food and shelter and colony cats are stray cats that live in groups fed by members of the public, but are not officially owned or cared for.
Feral cats on the other hand, have no degree of socialisation or dependence on humans.
A feral cat in the bush.
Tim Doherty
Claws for concern
In Australia, feral cats  outnumber stray and pet cats in terms of both absolute numbers and their relative impacts on native fauna. Feral cats prey on hundreds of species of birds, mammals and reptiles and have contributed to the
extinction
of more than 20 mammal species. It’s estimated that tens of millions of native animals are eaten by feral cats each night.
Make no mistake though, some stray and pet cats are natural born killers too. The majority of wildlife taken by cats in urban areas are likely to be rats, mice and common bird species, but cats are also a potential threat to endangered species that live in urban areas, like the western ringtail possum in Busselton, Western Australia and the southern brown bandicoot in south-eastern Melbourne.
A matter of life and death
Whether a cat is named as stray or feral could mean the difference between life and death for the animal.
Under
New Zealand’s Animal Welfare Act
, feral cats can be killed. Killing is acceptable for stray cats too, except where there is evidence of ownership, in which case the cat must be sent to a shelter for at least seven days.
The regulations in Australia are more complex, because each State and Territory has its own set of legislation. Nevertheless, feral cats are recognised as a pest and hence are subject to lethal control across Australia.
Under the guidelines of the International Society of Feline Medicine, stray cats qualify for rehoming, whereas feral cats do not. However, both groups of cats qualify for
trap-neuter-return
(TNR; a vexed issue in itself), and then “
occasionally euthanasia
” as a last resort.
Not everyone agrees on the best way to manage cats. One
study from the US
, perhaps unsurprisingly, found that the opinions of cat colony caretakers and bird conservation professionals were highly polarized, and a
study from the UK
found that cat rescue workers considered that most cats could be tamed and rehomed, whereas veterinarians generally considered that this was inappropriate for feral cats.
In Illinois
, rural residents were more likely to support lethal control of feral cats compared to urban residents , and in
Western Australia
, cat owners were less concerned about wildlife impacts and were less likely to favour controls than non-cat owners.
How to help
Managing the impacts of different groups of cats on wildlife requires different approaches. Keeping your pet cat indoors or confined to your property can prevent it from killing wildlife.
J Doherty
Collar-mounted
predation deterrents
like bells or pounce protectors can reduce predation rates. Also, having your male cat
desexed
will prevent it from breeding with other free-roaming cats and hence contributing new kittens to the stray population. Desexing your female cat avoids the problem of rehoming kittens.
Trap-neuter-return of stray and colony cats does nothing to prevent individual cats from killing wildlife. Feeding is ineffective too because cats may hunt even if they’re not hungry. Removal of stray cats from urban areas is the only way to stop them from eating wildlife.
Landscape scale control of feral cats in Western Australia can be achieved through
annual aerial baiting
and this is currently being tested in other parts of Australia too. Unfortunately though, the cats always come back, especially in good rainfall years. Predator-proof fencing and predator-free islands are important sanctuaries for threatened fauna that can’t survive even low levels of cat predation.
The future is looking pretty grim for Australian wildlife and reducing the impacts of cats in all categories is an essential component of fauna conservation plans, especially for our endangered birds and mammals."
Do you speak cat? Take this quiz to find out,https://theconversation.com/do-you-speak-cat-take-this-quiz-to-find-out-268217,"While often miscast as mysterious or hard to understand, cats are actually excellent communicators. In fact, in
free-ranging cat colonies
, physical fights are kept to a minimum through clever use of
body posturing, scent exchange and vocalisations
.
Cats have also
adapted their communication
for humans. For instance, adult cats don’t usually meow at each other. But when around people, cats meow a lot, suggesting they have adapted this vocalisation for communicating
with humans
.
And it’s not just the meow. Cats have a wide vocal repertoire for
conveying different meanings
, even for specific people. Bonded cats and humans often develop their own communication repertoires, similar to having a unique
dialect
.
Cats can understand human communication too. Studies show cats know their
own names and the names of their companions
, and can recognise
human emotions
, even changing their own behaviour in response.
Despite all this, humans still routinely misunderstand cats. Our new study,
published in Frontiers in Ethology
, shows just how little people understand the cues cats give. Try the quiz below to see how well
you
speak cat.
What we did
We asked 368 Australian participants to watch videos of human–cat play interactions. But not all the videos were “play” for the cat. Only half of the cats were playing, while the other half were actually showing signs they didn’t want to play, or were feeling stressed by the interaction.
After each video, participants were asked if they thought the interaction was overall positive or negative for the cat, based only on the cat’s behaviour. They were then asked how
they
would interact with the cat in the video they had just seen.
How well do you speak cat?
Watch the short videos below and decide: is the cat feeling positive or negative about the interaction? Remember to base your answers only on the cat’s behaviour.
What did our study find?
Results showed that participants struggled to recognise negative cues indicating discomfort or stress in cats.
For videos of cats who weren’t playing and were showing subtle negative cues (such as sudden tension in the body or avoiding touch), participants only recognised the negative cues about as well as chance (48.7%).
Even when participants watched videos of cats showing overt negative cues like hissing, biting or trying to escape, they still incorrectly categorised these as positive 25% of the time.
Recognising when a cat is stressed is only the first step. We also need to know how to respond to these cues.
Even when participants did successfully recognise negative cues, they often chose to engage with the cat in ways that would cause more stress and increase the risk of human injury, such as stroking, belly rubbing and playing with hands.
Cats are excellent communicators – you just need to know the signs.

Stress is unhealthy
Stress can have serious consequences. Cats who experience regular or prolonged stress (including from unwanted interactions like those in the negative videos) are at higher risk of heath issues such as
bladder inflamation
.
They’re also more likely to develop behaviours people find problematic, such as
increased aggression
or urinating outside of the litter tray. In turn, these behaviours increase risk of the cat being
euthanised or rehomed
.
Cat stress is bad for humans, too. If a person doesn’t heed early warning signs, the cat may bite or scratch,
depositing bacteria
and microorganisms
deep into the skin.
Rapid infection follows 30%–50%
of cat bites. If not treated promptly, it can lead to serious complications including
sepsis, chronic health issues and even death
. Cat bites and scratches can also transmit zoonotic diseases such as
cat scratch disease
.
Cats are less stressed when they’re not having to deal with unwanted interactions.
Fuzzy Rescue/Unsplash
How to play safely with cats
Watch for early warning signs a cat isn’t enjoying themselves and stop if you notice any. By the time cues are obvious, cats are already experiencing distress.
Early warnings include turning away, dodging or blocking attempts to touch, flinching, body tension, ears back or to the side, lip/nose licking and tail thrashing, slapping or tucking.
Touch
Avoid sensitive areas such as the belly, paws or the base of the tail. Cats prefer to be touched on the head and neck.
Avoid using hands to play. It teaches cats that hands are toys, and increases the risk of accidental injury. Instead, use toys that keep your face and hands away, such as a wand toy with a long handle.
Tail
Tail movements aren’t always a negative sign – they just mean the cat is emotionally stimulated and that could be from stress or excitement. Cats also use their tails for balance. So it’s best to consider the tail in combination with the whole body and the context.
Changes in tail movements can also give important clues to the cat’s mood. Generally, the bigger the movement, the more intense the feeling. So, if the movements start to get bigger or faster during play, or if a tail goes from relaxed to swishing when you touch, that might be a sign to back off.
Ears
Cats’ ears are like antennas that swivel and adjust to pinpoint sound, but they can also give us a clue to how they are feeling. If the ears move for a moment and then return to a relaxed position, that usually means they’re listening to the world around them. If the ears remain flattened and back, that’s a sign of distress.
Vocalisations
Trilling and chirruping both suggest a playful cat, while hissing, growling and yowling all indicate stress. Purring might seem positive but may indicate a cat is stressed and trying to self soothe.
Let them be
When early warnings don’t work, cats may show overt signs such as hissing, growling, trembling, hiding and, ultimately, biting or scratching.
If you notice warning signs, give the cat plenty of space. When stressed, cats don’t like being touched or having people too close. If the cat comes back and re-initiates contact, that’s a good sign they’re comfortable, but keep watch for warning signs returning.
If you pay attention to your cat’s behaviour and give them space when they need it, with a bit of practice you might just become fluent in cat."
Why Australia needs to kill cats,https://theconversation.com/why-australia-needs-to-kill-cats-116654,"Introduced cats are a
key threat
to 123 of Australia’s threatened species.
The management of cats is challenging and divisive; many options such as rehoming, trap-neuter-release and euthanasia have been used around the world with varying success.
Australia’s recent commitment to killing 2 million feral cats to protect its native wildlife has attracted
international attention
and some have considered the project harsh.
While the actual target of 2 million has been
rightly criticised
as arbitrary and more based on public relations than rigorous science, it’s true non-lethal methods are not enough to stem the environmental havoc cats cause. Particularly in light of a UN report highlighting the world’s extinction crisis, Australia urgently needs
well-targeted
cat culls.

Feral cat cull: why the 2 million target is on scientifically shaky ground
Non-lethal methods
A range of effective non-lethal methods are already protecting wildlife from cats. Cat-exclusion fences have
collectively improved
the conservation status of many threatened species. In addition, an increasing number of Australian councils have created progressive cat management bylaws designed to protect pet cats, wildlife and humans from the effects of free-ranging cats.
The centrepiece of many of these bylaws, supported by the vast majority of animal welfare groups, is the containment of pet cats on their owner’s property.
Indoor cats
live longer, safer lives than cats that are allowed to roam.
Stray cats are harder to manage. These are the cats that do not have a home, but may be directly or indirectly fed by people.

A hidden toll: Australia's cats kill almost 650 million reptiles a year
Because they are unowned, no-one is officially accountable for their health or welfare. Groups of like-minded individuals feed and even provide veterinary assistance to some of these cats, further blurring the distinction between pet and feral cats.
A trend promoted by “no kill” shelters and advocacy groups in some US states and Europe is for clowders (groups) of stray cats to be desexed, vaccinated and released back onto the streets. This process is called trap-neuter-release (TNR).
A recent RSPCA  best-practice cat management
discussion paper
proposed a trial of TNR in Australia too – but there are very good reasons why this would be counterproductive for cat welfare.
The risks of releasing unowned cats
Informed animal welfare advocate groups, including PETA, strongly condemn the release of unowned cats, neutered or otherwise, due to the welfare risks to these cats. Human health professionals and wildlife advocates also oppose maintaining groups of cats.
Dense outdoor cat clowders are hotbeds of toxoplasmosis infections. This cat-borne disease is increasingly being linked to a range of chronic mental health conditions including
schizophrenia
and
Alzheimer’s disease
.
“No kill” groups that promote TNR erroneously claim that neutered cats significantly reduce the breeding potential of erroneously named cat “colonies”, in the same way that release of neutered mosquitoes is a proven technique for controlling disease-bearing mosquitoes.
One of us (John) has recently written a book on
protecting wildlife and cats
that suggests five fatal biological flaws in this logic:
Neutering mosquitoes works because impotent individuals “swamp” short-lived wild insect populations that mate only once. By contrast, female cats typically mate repeatedly when on heat, so an encounter with a neutered tom is of little consequence.
Unlike lions, domestic cats evolved as solitary hunters. While domestic cats can tolerate living in high-density clowders, they do not form
hierarchical colonies
, packs or prides where alpha individuals restrict the feeding, breeding or survival of subordinate animals.
Although loud cat fights might make you assume males fight over the right to exclusively mate with a female, most litters of outdoor cats are sired by multiple males. Even supposedly “dominant” males seldom intervene when another male courts a female. Neutered male cats will not protect females in their clowder from non-desexed interlopers. This means that more than 90% of cats need to be neutered to restrict population increases, an incredibly challenging proposition.
Despite the misleading label “colony”, cat clowders are not closed populations. Rather, cats typically move around to take advantage of abundant food resources. And unwanted pets are often dumped at clowder sites. The failures of several
well-studied
TNR programs are attributed to cats migrating or being dumped at these sites.
Despite needing repeated vaccinations to protect them from debilitating diseases, few stray cats can be captured a second time. And many can never be captured at all. This leaves them and their clowder effectively unmanageable.
TNR is biologically flawed, cruel to cats – because it returns them to a hazardous environment – and ineffective when not accompanied by
high levels of adoption
.
Harming marine ecosystems
Not only do predatory cats harm native wildlife, but stray or feral clowders can also directly influence marine ecosystems and fisheries.
Many commercial cat foods contain increasingly threatened
predatory fish
that are high in the food chain and hence use more nutrients and biological energy than plants or herbivores. US dogs and cats consume
one-third of the animal-derived protein
eaten by humans, with accompanying greenhouse gas emissions.
The cat food provided to stray clowders adds to this biological expense. In 2009 alone, the US-based Best Friends Animal Society, one of the major promoters of TNR, distributed over 80,000 tonnes of cat food to unowned cats. There are no similar studies in Australia, and we appear to have far lower rates of stray-cat-feeding, but it is still part of the ecological impact of stray cats.
Even more insidiously, seals,
otters
and dolphins in oceans around the world die from cat-borne diseases spread mainly from clowders.

For whom the bell tolls: cats kill more than a million Australian birds every day
Humane euthanasia
Fortunately, both science and animal welfare standards are consistent about management of cats. All healthy domestic cats for which safe homes can be found should be adopted or rehomed, then kept indoors following neutering and vaccination. All other cats, including ferals and strays that cannot be rehomed quickly, should be humanely euthanased.
Feeding or releasing cats (neutered or otherwise) threatens our wildlife and perpetuates the cycle of suffering, disease, predation and social annoyance. Non-lethal options such as feral cat-proof fencing can still be part of the solution, but euthanasia remains an important part of controlling feral and stray cats to protect our native wildlife.

Why manage cats?
Unless we control the impact of cats, many native wildlife populations will continue to decline. Some will be driven to extinction, a sad and irreversible outcome for future generations and the ecosystems these species are part of.
Cats are versatile and highly effective predators. A large male cat can kill animals
up to about 4kg
– nearly as big as the cat itself.
Since they arrived in Australia with Europeans, cats have spread across
99% of the country
. Only some islands and
specially constructed fenced conservation
areas are cat-free.
Many native animal populations can’t cope with sustained hunting pressure from cats. Impacted species include
more than 200
of Australia’s nationally listed threatened species and
37 migratory species

of the mammal species present when cats arrived are now extinct. Cats played a major role in most of those 34 extinctions. And they continue to
drive population declines and regional extinctions
of susceptible species.

A strategic response
The government’s new
Threat Abatement Plan
aims to co-ordinate national efforts to reduce the impacts of feral cats on native wildlife. It follows extensive consultation with Indigenous ranger groups and First Nations organisations around the country, with members of the national
Feral Cat Taskforce
, and with threatened species and cat management experts.
Since cats occur just about everywhere, affect so many species and are elusive and hard to control, the plan is strategic: it prioritises the places and species for which controlling cats will have the greatest benefits.
Some significant successes have been achieved over the past decade or so, and the plan builds on those.

What are the priorities?
The plan’s objective is to improve outcomes for threatened and cat-susceptible native species, including
numbats, bettongs, bandicoots
and
island-nesting
seabirds.
Building from recent successes, it includes priorities for eradicating cats from islands and from within
fenced conservation areas
, because cats  cannot quickly recolonise these areas. These projects are critical for native species, such as
stick-nest rats
and
mala
(rufous hare-wallaby), that
can’t persist
even with a very low density of cats.
Populations of many native mammals, like mala, can’t survive with even low numbers of cats.

The plan also prioritises ongoing cat control in areas with important populations of threatened species that are highly vulnerable to cats, but which can persist as long as cat numbers are kept low.
This approach is valuable for species such as
rock wallabies
, which live in relatively small, well-defined areas, and for mammals of south-west Australia, which can be protected from cats and foxes by

Improving habitat management can also help reduce cat impacts across very large areas. For example,
improving habitat
in northern Australian tropical savannas, through better management of
fire and livestock
, can reduce cat impacts and increase native mammal populations. Cats
hunt most efficiently
in sparsely vegetated areas, so better cover provides more shelter for native wildlife.
In southern Australia,
reducing rabbit populations
also reduces cat numbers by removing an easy food source. This then relieves some of the predation pressure on native animals.

The mystery of the Top End's vanishing wildlife, and the unexpected culprits
What else is in the plan?
The plan proposes reforms of laws and regulations for pet and feral cats in all states and territories. For example, the plan includes actions to make laws on pet cat management more consistent across the country and to
encourage responsible pet ownership
. This means desexing cats and keeping cats contained so they can’t
harm wildlife
or produce kittens that end up as feral cats.

Herding cats: councils' efforts to protect wildlife from roaming pets are hampered by state laws
Many of Australia’s last strongholds for threatened species that are vulnerable to cats, such as
great desert skinks
,
bilbies
and
night parrots
, are in Indigenous Protected Areas and other Indigenous-managed land. The plan outlines practical support that Indigenous rangers want to help them manage cats.
Over the past few decades, we have learned much about the
impacts of cats and how best to manage them
. But we are still a long way from cost-effective, continent-scale solutions to protect native wildlife. The plan identifies the need for
new applied research
and the development and testing of effective control tools.
Who’s responsible?
Success will depend on focusing and enhancing the already significant efforts of governments, Indigenous and non-Indigenous land managers, environmental non-government organisations, industry, community groups, researchers and the public.
The Australian government will help to deliver the plan by co-ordinating actions and making strategic investments in management and research activity.

"250,000 cats have no owners in UK urban areas – but there are ways we can help",https://theconversation.com/250-000-cats-have-no-owners-in-uk-urban-areas-but-there-are-ways-we-can-help-170687,"The UK is home to around
10.8 million
owned pet cats. But the number of unowned cats living on the streets in the UK has remained largely unknown – until now.
Our
new research
, published in the journal Scientific Reports, sheds some light on the size of this vulnerable feline group. We’ve estimated there are 247,429 unowned cats across all urban areas of the UK.
Our figure is based on data collected from five urban towns and cities in the UK – Beeston, Bradford, Bulwell, Dunstable and Houghton Regis, and Everton – and then extrapolated. We chose these areas as we suspected they represented a spectrum of unowned cat density, including high density and low density areas.
We used information collected as part of
Cat Watch
, a community project set up by the UK’s feline welfare charity Cats Protection. Cat Watch encouraged residents to report sightings of unowned cats, initially during door-to-door surveys, and then through an app, social media, and directly to the Cat Watch team. The team worked to verify the information residents provided, resulting in 601 confirmed sightings of unowned cats.
There are a few challenges with reporting unowned cats, such as the fact owned and unowned cats can look the same. So observers may incorrectly identify an owned cat as an unowned cat, or vice versa. There might also be underreporting (because not all unowned cats will necessarily be visible), and multiple reports of the same cat. To account for these potential errors, we developed something called an
integrated abundance model
, which combined the information from residents with confirmed sightings verified by the community team.

In our five study areas, we found two factors had a significant association with unowned cats in the community. In areas with greater socioeconomic deprivation and higher population density, there tended to be more unowned cats. We applied these findings to the rest of the UK’s towns and cities using official population statistics and socioeconomic data. We calculated the average density of unowned cats across urban areas in the UK to be 9.3 cats per square kilometre, with variation from 1.9 to 57 cats.
We then combined these figures to calculate the national estimate of 247,429 unowned urban cats. While the number is not likely to be exactly right, our statistical analysis tells us there’s a 95% probability the true value lies somewhere between 157,153 and 365,793.

Compulsory cat microchipping is great in theory -- but the system is flawed
Why so many unowned cats?
The link between unowned cats and socio-economic deprivation isn’t entirely surprising. Previous work has recognised that fewer
owned
and
unowned cats
are neutered in deprived areas. When cats are unneutered, populations can expand rapidly.
There are a variety of factors which may explain the association between increased human population densities and increased densities of unowned cats. For example, there would be more pet cats in areas with more people, meaning more cats that can produce accidental litters if unneutered, and more cats that can be abandoned or stray from home. Further, unowned cats will be limited by resource availability. There may be more cats where there are more people because cats have greater access to food in these areas, for example from human food waste.
Unowned cats are likely to gravitate towards areas where they have better access to food.

What can we do?
We need continued research to improve our understanding of unowned cat populations. The predictions from our model increase in accuracy as we scale up to broader geographic areas, meaning our estimates will be more accurate at a national level compared to a street level, where there may be other local differences in cat populations. Areas with the highest human population densities in particular, such as London, require more research, as they were not among our original study sites.
Nonetheless, our research provides useful insight into the scale of the unowned cat population in the UK, and how unowned cat populations may vary across the urban landscape. This information can enable cat welfare charities to direct their support to areas of greatest need.

The curious character of cats – and whether they are really more aloof
Sadly, without a human caretaker or a regular source of food, water and shelter, unowned cats in urban areas are at heightened risk of many
diseases
and environmental hazards. Although figures vary, the life expectancy of an unowned cat has been estimated to be around
65% less
than that of a pet cat.
Common management practices for unowned cats include rehoming of strays (cats that are used to living in a home but have become lost or abandoned) for whom street life is unsuitable. Unsocialised cats – those that may have been born on the streets and not used to people (often termed feral or community cats) – can be neutered and returned to areas, ideally where there is a cat caretaker who can keep an eye on them and provide food or
a shelter
. This is commonly termed
trap-neuter-return
.
Our findings of a close association between unowned cats and human communities suggest that successful cat population management in urban areas will also require supporting cat owners to microchip their cats to prevent them getting lost.
Additionally, it’s important we support owners to have their cats neutered before potential breeding age to prevent any unplanned litters. Our
earlier research
has highlighted how the long-term effectiveness of any trap-neuter-return and rehoming programs can be improved by simultaneously working with communities to
encourage neutering

Are you a cat whisperer? How to read Fluffy’s facial expressions,https://theconversation.com/are-you-a-cat-whisperer-how-to-read-fluffys-facial-expressions-128686,"Cats are popular pets: there are an
estimated 200 million pet cats worldwide
, with more
pet cats than pet dogs
. Cats live in about
38 per cent of Canadian households
,
25.4 per cent of American households
and
25 per cent of European households
.
Cats also seem to be a great source of entertainment. There are
two million cat videos on YouTube and counting
, and countless internet-famous cats, like Grumpy Cat and Lil’ Bub, each with millions of followers on their social media accounts.
Despite the popularity of cats, as anyone who has been around a cat knows, reading cats is not always an easy task. One minute they can be seeking your affection and the next they can be swatting at you without any apparent warning. This leads to the question: are cats just jerks or are they simply misunderstood?
Cats’ body language
While cats may seem mysterious, their behaviour can help us to understand how they are feeling. The position of a cat’s body, head, ears and tail are all telltale hints.
An
anxious or fearful cat
may crouch down to the ground, arch their back, lower their head and flatten their ears. Fearful or anxious cats may also retreat backwards in avoidance, hide themselves, make their fur stand on edge (piloerection),
growl, hiss, spit
, swat or bite.
Conversely, a content cat may approach you with their tail up, with their body and head in a neutral position and their ears forward. When resting, they may tuck their paws in, or lay on their side with their legs stretched out.
Cats’ emotions can be deciphered through their different behaviours.

Facial expressions may also be an indicator of how cats are feeling. Researchers have found that
certain individuals can readily distinguish the images of cats in pain from those of pain-free cats
. Despite this, the full range of cat facial expressions, including those made in positive situations, has not received much investigation.
Most people are poor cat face readers
As a postdoctoral researcher in animal science, I ran an
online study
in which participants were shown short video clips of cats in various situations. Positive situations were those where cats approached, for example, their owner for treats. Negative situations were those where cats sought to avoid, for example, retreating from a person unknown to them.
The videos were carefully selected based on
strict behavioural criteria
and edited to only show each cat’s face, removing any potential body language or location cues.
An example of a video from the study: here, a cat is kneading in his favoured resting spot, a positive situation.
More than 6,300 people from 85 countries judged whether the cat in each video was feeling positive or negative. On average, people identified the correct expression 59 per cent of the time. While this score is slightly better than if people had simply guessed, it suggests that many people find the task of reading cat faces challenging.
An example of a video from the study: here, a cat is hiding in the examination room of a veterinary clinic, a negative situation.
Cat whisperers
Although most people were poor cat face readers, a small subset of people (13 per cent) were quite skilled, scoring 15 points or higher out of a possible 20 points.
Individuals in this group are more likely to be women than men. This is not surprising, since research has found that women are generally better at interpreting non-verbal emotional cues; this has been shown with
human babies
and dogs
.
I found “cat whisperers” also tend to have experience working as a veterinarian or veterinary technician. People in these occupations encounter a large number of cats on a daily basis and must learn to interpret their behaviour to recognize illness and avoid injury.
Suprisingly (or not, depending on your personal experience as a cat owner), cat owners are not any better at reading cat faces than people who have never owned a cat. This may be because cat owners learn the intricacies of their own cat through continued interactions, but likely cannot draw on varied experiences when faced with a series of unfamiliar cats.
Implications for animal welfare
My work has shown that cats display different facial expressions and that these facial expressions differ depending on how cats are feeling, both positive and negative.
Being able to read and interpret these different facial expressions can help to ensure that cats receive appropriate care. For example, facial expressions can indicate when a cat may be in pain and require treatment. Being able to read cat faces can also improve the bond between cat owners and their cats, through an improved understanding of how their cats may be feeling.
While many people seem to struggle with reading cat faces, some individuals are able to read them well. This suggests that interpreting cat faces is a skill that could improve with training and experience.

Two-thirdsof us support banning pet cats from roaming. A ban would save millions of native animals – and billions of dollars,https://theconversation.com/two-thirds-of-us-support-banning-pet-cats-from-roaming-a-ban-would-save-millions-of-native-animals-and-billions-of-dollars-229180,"Australians have more pet cats than ever before – more than
5 million
in total. With the growing number, expectations on pet owners are shifting.
Many cat owners are now voluntarily keeping their cats indoors or in secure runs, and local governments mandate it in some areas. But most pet cats in Australia still roam local streets and gardens.
Broader adoption of keeping cats safe at home would have large benefits for cat welfare, human health, local wildlife and even the economy. So, should pet owners be required to keep their pets contained to their property, as dogs are?
We put that question to thousands of people in a national survey in late 2023, and
recently published
the results.
We found most people support requiring owners to contain cats. Just
one in 12 people
(8%) are opposed. The time might be right for nationwide change in how we manage our pet cats.
Keeping pet cats indoors protects native animals, especially birds and reptiles during the daytime and mammals like possums during the night.
Jaana Dielenberg
Local councils are embracing cat containment
From November 1, Geelong City Council
will join
a fast-growing group of local governments in urban and regional areas that require pet cats to be securely contained 24 hours a day.
More than
a third
of local councils in Australia now require cats to be contained overnight or 24 hours a day. Most are in the ACT and Victoria.
Given how good cats are at climbing and jumping, containing cats usually requires keeping them indoors or in secure runs.
The main reasons cited by local govenments for these regulations are:
improving pet welfare
:
contained cats live longer and healthier lives with fewer vet bills because they are
protected
from traumatic injuries from car accidents, dog attacks and cat fights, infections, diseases and other misadventures.
saving wildlife:
four out of five cats
allowed outside will hunt and kill an average of two to three animals per week. With millions of pet cats in Australia, each year this adds up to
6,000–11,000 animals
killed in our suburbs per square kilometre and
323 million native animals
killed nationally. Night curfews only protect nocturnal species such as possums.
reducing nuisance to neighbours:
containment results in less disturbance from cat fights and prevents the neighbour’s cat killing the birds and lizards living in your backyard or nearby park, which many community members value.
The public health toll of roaming cats
Another major benefit is less talked about. Stopping pet cats from roaming would greatly reduce rates of cat-borne diseases.
Several diseases which
could not exist
without cats can be passed to humans. These cost Australia more than
$6 billion
a year based on costs of medical care, lost income and other related expenses.
The most widespread of these diseases is
toxoplasmosis
, a parasitic infection that can be passed to humans but must complete its life cycle in cats. Australian studies have reported human infection rates between
22% and 66%
of the community.
Cat-borne diseases cause considerable community harm, with an
estimated
8,500 hospitalisations and 550 deaths from
acute infections
and also from increased rates of
car accidents
,
suicides
and
mental health
issues in infected people.
Pet cats are crucial to the rates of these diseases in the community. In suburbs that do not require containment, you’ll find up to
100 roaming pet cats
per square kilometre.
Eliminating stray cats from our suburbs is also important to reduce disease rates – just one of the reasons why people should not feed stray cats.

Most of us support containment
A policy requiring all cats to be contained has clear benefits. But would it have support? Rules only produce benefits if people follow them.
This is why colleagues at Monash University and I surveyed more than 3,400 people on whether they would support policies that “require cat owners to keep their cat contained to their property”.
We found a clear majority (66%) of people support cat containment. A strikingly small proportion of people, about one in 12 people (8%), are opposed. The remaining 26% were ambivalent, selecting “neither support nor oppose”.
Other surveys have found almost half (42% or
2.2 million
) of Australia’s pet cats are already kept contained by their owners.
Some councils can’t legally require cat containment
Our findings suggest communities would broadly support their local councils if they moved to require cats to be contained.
While councils are responsible for pet issues, state and territory laws
greatly influence
what councils can and can’t do.
In
New South Wales
and
Western Australia
, state laws actually prevent local councils from requiring cat containment (except for in
specific
circumstances, such as in declared food preparation areas in NSW).
Rules are just the start
To boost compliance, councils need to invest in communicating new rules and the reasons for them. After a grace period, council officers will also need to monitor and enforce the rules.
Communities may need support too, especially if there are costs involved. Councils could, for example, offer rebates for flyscreens to stop cats slipping out of open windows.
Working with
other colleagues
in 2020, we
surveyed
Australia’s local governments about their approaches to cat management. Most reported tiny budgets for cat management.
Local governments should not be left to shoulder the cost alone.
Federal
,
state
and
territory
governments are also responsible for Australia’s wildlife (and human health). These governments have a range of projects covering both
feral
and pet cats.
The Australian government collects
A$3 billion
a year in GST from spending on pets. Diverting a small proportion into responsible pet ownership programs would make an enormous difference.
Policies such as rebates for the cost of window screens could help the community to transition to keeping cats indoors.
Jaana Dielenberg
Containment has wide backing
Our research shows the community is ready for widespread reform of how we manage all these cats.
Requiring pet cats to be contained is a sound policy choice. But to realise the  full benefits, we also need to invest in effective communication for communities, provide rebates to help contain cats, and make sure the rules are followed.
This research was a team effort, involving Kim Borg, Melissa Hatty and Emily Gregg for the national survey, and Sarah Legge, John Woinarski and Tida Nou for the research on cat impacts and management."
"Australia’s war on feral cats: shaky science, missing ethics",https://theconversation.com/australias-war-on-feral-cats-shaky-science-missing-ethics-47444,"In July 2015, the Australian government announced a “
war on feral cats
,” with the intention of killing over two million felines by 2020. The
threat abatement plan
to enforce this policy includes a mix of shooting, trapping and a reputedly “humane” poison.
Some conservationists in Australia are hailing this as an important step toward the
rewilding of Australia’s outback
, or the idea of restoring the continent’s biodiversity to its state prior to European contact. Momentum has also been building in the United States for
similar action
to protect the many animals outdoor cats kill every year.
In opposition are animal advocates including the
British singer Morrissey
who are appalled at the rhetoric of a war on cats and promote nonlethal methods of controlling the negative effects of cats as being
more effective and humane
.
Who is right? The truth lies somewhere in between and is a matter of both science and ethics.
Guesstimates
Today’s
house cat
(
Felis catus
) originated as the North African wildcat (
Felis silvestris lybica
). When a house cat roams or lives outside, it is called an outdoor cat. This category includes cats who are owned, abandoned or lost. Feral cats are house cats who have reverted to the wild, and are generally born and raised without human companionship or socialization. This makes a huge difference in their behavior.
After a certain point as kittens, cats are almost impossible to socialize and are “feral” – from the Latin term
ferus
for wild. While there is a related debate over whether house cats are
domesticated
at all, they have nevertheless so thoroughly infiltrated human societies that they are now distributed throughout the world, and along with dogs are
humankind’s favorite mammalian companion animal
.
From a scientific perspective, there is little doubt that under particular geographic and ecological conditions, outdoor cats can threaten native species. This is especially true on oceanic islands whose wildlife evolved without cats and are consequently unadapted to feline predators. For example, when cats were introduced to Pacific islands by European colonists, their numbers grew until they frequently posed a
threat to native wildlife
.
Feral cat map.
Australian Department of the Environment
On mainlands, areas of high biodiversity that are isolated from surrounding habitats can respond like “terrestrial islands” to introduced species. In Australia, cats can be a threat to quolls, a carnivorous marsupial, and other indigenous wildlife if dingoes or Tasmanian devils are not around to keep them in check. A similar situation occurs in North American cities and countrysides, where coyotes vastly reduce the impact of outdoor cats on wildlife.
This ability to disturb ecological communities should come as no surprise. Scientists often refer to species as native, exotic or invasive. While there are historical criteria that play a role in making this determination, it is primarily a value judgment about where a species comes from, and whether it has a positive, neutral or destructive impact on the environment. Over the course of time, ecological communities adapt and immigrant species become native to their place. The baseline for assessing damage is usually the natural world as it was before the European age of exploration.
Cats are indeed an exotic species outside their ancestral home (Europe and North Africa), and they interact with the natural environment in myriad ways. They can also run amok by the standards noted above. However, whether cats are judged destructive is really a matter of context. Isolated Pacific islands that have never seen a cat are a far cry from cities where they are a normal element of urban ecology.
Of course, we might say the same about humans, although outside of extremists’ debates over politics and immigration, we do not use these terms nor advocate the mass slaughter of other people. We recognize this to be unethical.
Still, some conservationists claim that cats are the single largest threat to biodiversity regardless of ecological context. One oft-cited
study
in
Nature Communications
claims that 1.4 to 3.7 billion birds and 6.9 to 20.7 billion small mammals are killed by cats every year in the United States alone. Yet the scientific case for this claim is shaky at best.
Why? Virtually every study of outdoor cats assumes that because cats in some habitats threaten biodiversity, they are a threat across all habitats everywhere. This is a projection from a small set of localized case studies to the world at large. In other words, a guesstimate.
This is why the ranges of birds and mammals preyed upon that are cited above are so wide. Such guesstimates are neither descriptive nor predictive of the world. Some advocates have criticized such studies as junk science. For a particularly sustained critique see
Vox Felina
, which aims to “improve the lives of feral cats” through more thorough discussion. I think calling the academic literature junk science overstates the case a tad. Such studies can improve our understanding about what happens in similar situations, even if they cannot be generalized to all cats everywhere.
These studies, though, make little effort to understand the complexities of outdoor cats interacting with wildlife. When they do, the picture they reveal is quite different from what the guesstimates assume.
For instance,
kitty-cam studies
show that most cats hang out, visit the neighbors and do not travel far from home. In addition, if there are competing predators nearby, they tend to
exclude cats
from the area. This is particularly true of coyotes in the North America, and is thought to be the case with
dingoes
and perhaps
Tasmanian devils
in Australia.

And shocking as it might seem, there are no empirical studies on just how many feral or outdoor cats exist. No one has actually tried to count the actual number of cats out there. All the numbers bandied about are guesstimates.
For example, it is common for the Australian press and authorities to claim there are roughly 20 million feral cats. Yet as ABC News in Australia discovered, these figures are
unverifiable
. Even the authors of the scientific report used to justify the war on cats admit there is
no scientific basis
for estimating the number of outdoor cats in Australia. Similar uncertainties apply to guesstimates about feral cats in Europe and North America. They exemplify the term “urban legend.”
So scientists really have no idea how many feral cats are in Australia or North America. What’s more, they have a poor grasp of how much of a real impact feral or nonferal cats make on wildlife.
If the science about cats and their impact on biodiversity is this unreliable, then why is Australia talking about a war against feral cats? Why are conservationists in North America in such a lather about instituting similar lethal control programs?
The answer: it is all about ethics.
Look in the mirror
While rarely voiced, many conservationists hold unarticulated moral norms about repairing the damage done to Mother Earth by human civilization.
The moral responsibilities of being good stewards of the Earth mean the protection of endangered species, the preservation of natural habitat, conserving resources, reducing pollution and so on. Given the depredations of the human species (as a whole) on the Earth’s other life forms and living systems, environmental conservation is indeed a praiseworthy goal. Especially when it considers how to
rewild the Earth
so that other species besides humans might thrive.
Yet this worldview suffers from a number of blind spots that many conservationist are simply unwilling to see.
The first is the moral value of individual animals. Most conservationists recognize the moral value of ecological systems. Aldo Leopold’s “
land ethic
” is a universal touchstone for this belief. Leopold held that humans and nature (collectively “the land”) were part of the same community to whom ethical responsibilities were owed. Yet conservationists still tend to view animals as biological machines, functional units of ecological processes, and commodities for human use.
The problem is that they fail to apply the lessons learned from their own dogs and cats – namely, that many nonhuman animals are feeling and thinking creatures and have
intrinsic value
in their
own right
. In other words, individual animals as well as ecological communities have moral value apart from any use we may have for them. This means we have ethical responsibilities to cats as well as to biodiversity, and need to do a better job of balancing the well-being of both.
The second blind spot is blaming the victim. Are cats any more of an invasive species than human beings? Who transported cats across the world so that they are now one of the most widely distributed mammalian carnivores? See
John Bradwhaw’s Cat Sense (2013)
for a history of this global distribution.
When compared to humanity’s destruction and degradation of habitats, extinction of species, and the sprawl of our cities and economic activity, are we really to believe that it is cats who are the enemy of biodiversity? And what about
cats who “fit” into urban ecologies
, taking the place of otherwise absent predators and contributing ecological services in the form of pest control? Blaming cats instead of humanity’s unsustainable behaviors seems too easy, too simple, and a deflection away from
the species that is truly culpable
for the sorry state of our world.
The third issue conservationists do not typically address is the questionable moral legitimacy of lethal management. Traditional conservation likes to think of lethal measures, such as hunting, trapping and poisoning, as an unproblematic tool for achieving management goals. The legitimacy of this rests on the assumption that “individuals don’t matter,” itself a reflection that only people and/or ecosystems, not individual animals, have intrinsic moral value.

Yet there is a powerful movement of wildlife advocates and managers pushing back against this presumption. Flying under various names like
humane wildlife management
and
compassionate conservation
– its proponents say we should consider the well-being of both ecosystems and individual animals. This is right not only because of the intrinsic value of the animals being managed, but because many of these animals require stable social structures to thrive.
While feral cats may live solitary lives, outdoor cats in general are very social, frequently living with human beings, being cared for as community cats and interacting with other felines in extended cat colonies. Out of respect for cats and the people who care for them, we should give preference to nonlethal alternatives in management first and foremost.
To be sure, advocates for outdoor cats often have their own scientific and ethical blind spots about cats on the whole and about nonlethal management strategies. There may even be times when the threat of feral cats to a vulnerable species is so great that lethal action may be justified.
Nevertheless, even the most ardent supporter of rewilding should admit that it is human beings who bear direct moral responsibility for the ongoing loss of biodiversity in our world. A war on cats ignores their intrinsic value, wrongly blames them for mistakes of our own making, and fails to adequately use nonlethal measures to manage cats and wildlife.
As an ethicist, I care about both native wildlife and cats. It is time to stop blaming the victim, face up to our own culpability and seek to rewild our world with an eye to the ethics of our actions. There is no justification for a war on outdoor cats – feral or otherwise – based on shaky science and an absence of ethical reasoning."
"To protect wildlife fromfree-roamingcats, a zone defense may be more effective than trying to get every feline off the street",https://theconversation.com/to-protect-wildlife-from-free-roaming-cats-a-zone-defense-may-be-more-effective-than-trying-to-get-every-feline-off-the-street-180228,"Should domestic cats be allowed to roam freely outdoors? It’s a contentious issue. Those who say yes assert that they’re
defending outdoor cats
and the
people who care for them
. Critics respond that free-roaming cats
kill so many birds, reptiles, mammals and important insects like butterflies and dragonflies
that they
threaten biodiversity on a global scale
.
As
conservation
biologists
familiar with these clashing viewpoints, we wondered whether there was room for a more nuanced strategy than the typical yes/no standoff. In a
recently published study
, we used camera traps at hundreds of sites across Washington, D.C., to analyze the predatory behavior of urban free-roaming cats. The cameras recorded all cats that passed them, so our study did not distinguish between feral cats and pet cats roaming outdoors.
Our data showed that the cats were unlikely to prey on native wildlife, such as songbirds or small mammals, when they were farther than roughly 1,500 feet (500 meters) from a forested area, such as a park or wooded backyard. We also found that when cats were approximately 800 feet (250 meters) or farther from forest edges, they were more likely to prey on rats than on native wildlife.
Since the average urban domestic cat ranges over a small area –
roughly 550 feet
(170 meters), or
one to two city blocks
– the difference between a diet that consists exclusively of native species and one without any native prey can be experienced within a single cat’s range. Our findings suggest that focusing efforts on managing cat populations near forested areas may be a more effective conservation strategy than attempting to manage an entire city’s outdoor cat population.
Cats have an instinctual drive to hunt, even when they’re well-fed, and pursue many types of prey.
Cats on the loose
Free-roaming cats are a common sight in Washington, D.C., which has a feline population of
200,000
. Like many cities, Washington has had its share of
cat management controversies

Professionals on either side of the free-roaming cat debate largely agree that cats are safest when kept indoors. An outdoor cat’s lifespan generally peaks
around 5 years
, compared with 10 to 15 years for an indoor cat. Free-roaming cats face numerous threats, including vehicle collisions and contact with rat poison. Acknowledging these risks, most animal welfare organizations encourage
an indoor-only lifestyle
.
Similarly, there is little disagreement that cats hunt; for centuries humans have used them for rodent control. But invasive rats, which are often the target of modern rodent control,
can grow too large
to be easy prey for cats. In response, cats also pursue smaller species that are easier to catch. Studies have linked cats to
63 extinctions globally
and estimated that cats
kill 12.3 billion wild mammals
annually in the U.S. alone.
Disagreements arise around handling cats that already live outside. Population management programs often utilize trap-neuter-return, or TNR – a process in which cats are trapped, spayed or neutered and re-released where they were caught.
In theory, TNR limits population growth by reducing the number of kittens that will be born. In reality it is rarely effective, since
75% of individual cats must be treated every year
to reduce the population, which is often not feasible. Regardless, reproduction itself is not what most worries conservation biologists.
Feline invaders
Today the Earth is losing wild species at such a rate that many scientists believe it is experiencing its
sixth mass extinction
. In this context, free-roaming cats’ effects on wildlife are a serious concern. Cats have an instinctual drive to hunt, even if they are fed by humans. Many wildlife populations are
already struggling to survive
in a rapidly changing world. Falling prey to a non-native species doesn’t help.
Cats
aren’t picky hunters
but will pounce on the easiest available prey. This generalist predatory behavior contributes to their reputation as
one of the most damaging invasive species
. In our view, however, it could also be a key to limiting their ecological impact.
This graphic shows the numbers of threatened and extinct bird (B), mammal (M) and reptile (R) species negatively affected by invasive mammalian predators. Gray bars are the total number of extinct and threatened species, and red bars are extinct species. Predators (L to R) are the cat, rodents, dog, pig, small Indian mongoose, red fox and stoat.

Managing cats based on their behavior
Since cats are generalist predators, their wild-caught diet tends to reflect the local species that are available. In areas with more birds than mammals,
like New Zealand
, birds are cats’ primary prey. Similarly, cat diets in the most developed portions of cities likely reflect the most available prey species – rats.
While cats top the list of harmful invasive species,
rats aren’t far behind
. In cities, rats spread disease, contaminate food and
damage infrastructure
. There aren’t many downsides to free-roaming cats preying on rats.
City centers have
no shortage of rats
, which can live anywhere, including parks, subways, sewers and buildings. But native animals tend to stay in or near
areas with sufficient outdoor habitat
, like parks and forested neighborhoods. When cats hunt in these same spaces, they are a threat to native wildlife. But if cats don’t share these spaces with native species, the risk declines dramatically.
The National Park Service built a specially designed 5-mile fence on the island of Hawaii to protect endangered petrels from predation by feral cats.
Conservation funding is limited, so it’s critical to choose effective strategies. The traditional approach to cat management has largely consisted of attempting to prohibit cats from being loose altogether – an approach that’s incredibly unpopular with people who care for outdoor cats. Despite
calls for outdoor cat bans
, few have been enacted.
Instead, we suggest prioritizing areas where wildlife is most at risk. For example, cities could create “no cat zones” near urban habitats, which would forbid releasing trap-neuter-return cats in those areas and fine owners in those areas who let their cats roam outdoors.
In Washington, D.C., this would include
forested neighborhoods
like Palisades or Buena Vista, as well as homes near parks like Rock Creek. As we see it, this targeted approach would have more impact than citywide outdoor cat bans that are unpopular and difficult to enforce.
Hard-line policies have done little to reduce outdoor cat populations across the U.S. Instead, we believe a data-driven and targeted approach to cat management is a more effective way to protect wildlife.

My cat needs to be contained indoors – how do I make sure it stays happy?,https://theconversation.com/my-cat-needs-to-be-contained-indoors-how-do-i-make-sure-it-stays-happy-263333,"In Australia, there are
some 5 million pet cats
, and several million feral cats that live outdoors and away from human care, with
devastating consequences for native wildlife
.
While
there’s debate
over just how much domestic cats
harm wildlife
, two-thirds of Australians
support keeping cats indoors only
.
An increasing number of councils around the country either have overnight or 24-hour curfews for our furry, clawed friends.
But if your cat is used to going outside unsupervised at least some of the time, is it possible to transition them to an indoor-only lifestyle? Here are the welfare questions to consider.
Do cats
need
outdoor access?
In 2023, the European Union
adopted a scientific report
on dog and cat welfare in commercial breeding establishments. This work, which I participated in, was a thorough review of the current literature and national regulations.
Based on the scientific evidence, access to outdoor space was requested for dogs, but did not become a requirement for cats in Europe. The necessity for cats to have outdoor access remains a matter of scientific debate.
Meanwhile, the Australian Veterinary Association
recommends keeping pet cats contained
“on their owners’ properties”:
Contained cats require an appropriate environment with enrichment that meets the cats’ physical and mental needs, allows expression of natural behaviours, promotes good health and welfare and minimises stress. This should include controlled outdoor access where possible.
On the one hand, many cat owners, particular those living in rural areas, prefer to let their cats roam free, as they believe the outdoors provides cats with exercise and allows them to engage in natural behaviours such as
hunting, exploring and climbing
.
But uncontrolled outdoor access has many negative impacts
on the welfare of pet cats
. Free-roaming cats are at a higher risk of disease and parasites, injuries or death from car accidents, accidentally ingesting toxins, unwanted pregnancies, and becoming lost.
Uncontrolled access to the outdoors exposes pet cats to many dangers.

How can I safely contain my cat?
Whether you’re moving house and can’t provide outdoor access any more, or your council is implementing a curfew on cats, you may find yourself in a situation where your outdoors-loving cat now has to be confined.
A
good indoor home
for a cat must have easy access to food, water and a litter tray, a safe physical environment, comfortable places to sleep or to hide, and plenty of ways to engage in play and other activities, including scratching posts and raised platforms to survey their territory from.
Hopefully, your cat already has all of these things.

How can I keep my cat happy? 5 tips from a vet to help your feline friend live their best life
However, our pets’ experiences and attitudes are also shaped by their breed, temperament, and the environment they grow up in. A cat that’s only lived indoors in a good home is more likely to be content and happy in its confinement.
But a pet cat that’s always been allowed to wander around and suddenly isn’t allowed to do so, may end up distressed and “act out”.
One of the most common behavioural problems is soiling outside the litter tray. That’s because a cat who’s been habitually using the outdoors as a toilet
may not like the litter box as much
.
However, a cat may also be stressed by a change in its environment, which can increase the risk of developing a urinary tract infection. In such cases, the cat might start peeing outside the litter box, often choosing cool surfaces such as sinks or bathtubs. Because house soiling can have both medical and behavioural causes, it is
always best to consult a veterinarian
.
Other signs of distress can be increased aggression, or becoming depressed and spending lots of time hiding. So, if you notice any changes in your cat’s behaviour, consult your vet. They can first rule out any stress-related medical conditions and then guide you on how to best support your cat through this transition.
Pet cats such as Cleo (the author’s cat) can have plenty of comfort when safely kept indoors in an appropriate environment.
Barbara Padalino
It’s not all or nothing
Among the many good recommendations for making your cat’s indoor environment more engaging is the use of
cognitive enrichment
. You can offer puzzle feeders or play hide-and-seek with your cat.
Another effective option is a clicker training program, which has been shown to provide both mental stimulation and
improved welfare for cats
. It involves
using a small clicker device
and an immediate treat to reward the animal for a desired behaviour.
With clicker training, you can teach your cat a variety of simple tasks, turning learning into a fun and rewarding activity. For example, clicker training can help your cat become more comfortable entering a pet carrier, enjoying car rides, or even walking on a leash – so you can start bringing your cat outdoors with you.
While free roaming may no longer be an option for your cat, it doesn’t mean they can’t experience any outdoor time at all.
With successful training, you can take your cat outdoors on a leash.

Where possible, you could build a cat-proof fence on your yard, have a fully enclosed outdoor space (a “catio”) or even investigate virtual fencing options
if they are permitted in your state
. These involve a transmitter paired with a collar that makes a sound or vibrates when the cat reaches an invisible boundary.
You can also make sure your cat has a GPS tracker on their collar in case they do manage to escape.
Ultimately, the response to permanent confinement will vary among individual cats. As the owner, you are best placed to watch them for any behavioural changes and make sure their quality of life is still good."
Why do cats knead with their paws?,https://theconversation.com/why-do-cats-knead-with-their-paws-156254,"Curious Kids

Why do cats like to pat their paws on a soft blanket? – Anonymous
Do you ever see your cat shifting his front paws back and forth just before settling down for a nap? Have you heard some cat lovers talk about their feline friends “making biscuits” or “kneading dough”?
Scientists who study cat behavior call this distinctive paw action “kneading” and believe it to be a sign of a relaxed cat. My own cats knead before taking a nap near me. While they are kneading, they purr – one of them gets so relaxed, he sometimes drools.
Kneading usually occurs near a favorite person
.
As a veterinarian
, I think it’s important to recognize the little moments your cat is telling you she’s happy to be near you.
Kneading in kittens
If you’re ever around newborn kittens, you will see kneading pretty quickly after birth. A
kitten kneads on his mother’s abdomen
as a way of telling her he is hungry and ready for her milk.
Kneading and purring.
At the same time, the kitten usually purrs, which is a sound created by rapid vibrations of certain throat muscles.
Purring is a signal for attention
.
Using these two behaviors, kittens are asking their moms, also known as queens, to remain still so they can continue suckling. Young kittens usually fall asleep while suckling.
Kittens stop drinking their mother’s milk by about two months of age. So why do cats continue to knead as adults?
Ready to relax
Kneading seems to be more common in some cats than others. If your cat doesn’t knead, it could mean he is a little stressed – or it could just be that your cat doesn’t display relaxation or affection in that manner.
But many cats do continue kneading into adulthood. It’s pretty safe to assume a cat who is kneading is feeling calm, content and ready to settle down, just like a kitten settling in to suckle and sleep.
Cats can mark areas with scent glands in their feet.
vizland/iStock via Getty Images Plus
You may already know that when your
cat bunts
, or butts his head and rubs his cheek, head and body against your leg or an object near you, he is putting his scent in these locations. Cats also have scent glands between their toes, prompting some people to suggest that cats are also putting a familiar, comforting scent on their sleeping area when they knead.
Don’t bother to look for these glands on your own cat. They are not easily visible.
Subtle signals
Kneading may also be a form of communication between cats and their people.
If you’ve been around dogs, you know most are quite obvious in letting humans know they want something or like someone.
For thousands of years, people have purposely bred dogs
to be fun companions, as well as to have useful behaviors such as herding, tracking or guarding.
Cats and people have also
lived together for thousands of years
– and humans have appreciated their amazing natural mousing skills.
Only recently have people tried to breed cats
, but mostly for their appearance, not for specific behaviors.
The result is that cats are a little more subtle than dogs in their ways of telling a person, “I like you.” Kneading is one of those clues.

Dogs and cats get diabetes too. Here’s what to look out for and how to manage it,https://theconversation.com/dogs-and-cats-get-diabetes-too-heres-what-to-look-out-for-and-how-to-manage-it-225673,"Learning a pet has diabetes can be a shock. Sadly, about 20% of diabetic cats and dogs
are euthanised
within a year of diagnosis due to the impacts on the pets’ health and their owners’ lifestyle and finances.
However, the disease can be managed. And for cats, but not dogs, effective early treatment even gives them a
good chance of remission
.
Diabetes in cats and dogs is fairly common – though not as
common as in humans
. 
It affects about
1.5% of dogs and 0.5–1% of cats
.
So what exactly is diabetes? What are the warning signs? And how do you manage the disease?
Being overweight increases the risk of diabetes in cats, as in people, and to a lesser extent in dogs.

What is diabetes?
Glucose
is the body’s primary energy source.
Insulin
, a hormone produced in the pancreas, regulates levels of this blood-borne sugar, its uptake into cells and its
storage
in the liver and muscles.
In animals with diabetes, the body does not secrete enough insulin. The result is high glucose levels (
hyperglycemia
) and associated clinical signs.
Some breeds and unspayed female dogs are
more at risk
, as are middle-aged, older and
obese
animals
.
Diabetes mellitis (its full scientific name) is generally classified into four main types:
1. Type 1 diabetes
This form results from
autoimmune destruction
of insulin-producing
pancreatic cells
, because the immune system attacks them by mistake.
Type 1 is common in dogs but
rare in cats
. Its onset in dogs, usually in middle age, is often insidious.
Type 1 diabetes is most common in dogs.

2. Type 2 diabetes
This form is characterised by insulin resistance and dysfunction in cells that produce insulin. It accounts for
most cases in cats
but is rare in dogs.
The major
risk factors
are obesity and increasing age. Other factors include genetics, physical inactivity and being kept indoors and the use of
glucocorticoid
steroids.
In the earlier stages, when the cat is still producing some insulin of its own, type 2 diabetes can be managed using drugs that reduce blood glucose. The drugs are formally known as “sodium-glucose transporter 2” or (
SGLT2
) inhibitors.
For more advanced cases, insulin injections are essential. Long-acting insulin in cats typically controls blood glucose levels
better than
the intermediate-acting insulins typically used in dogs.
Weight loss is also important for
overweight or obese animals
. The maximum safe rate of weight loss is 1-2% of body weight a week in cats, so achieving an ideal weight can take 6–12 months. Adding steamed zucchini to each meal can help with weight loss.
Getting the diet right is important for managing diabetes in cats and dogs.

3. Other specific types
Some diabetes types are caused by
other medical conditions
such as chronic pancreatitis, which is common in diabetic dogs, or acromegaly in cats, where too much growth hormone results in marked insulin resistance.
4. Dioestrus and Gestational diabetes
Diabetes can occur in older female dogs after they have been in heat. In dioestrus, secretion of increased growth hormone from mammary glands counteracts insulin. Although
very rare in pets
, female dogs can get transient diabetes in pregnancy.
What are the signs to look for?
Signs of diabetes usually emerge slowly over
weeks to months
. If diagnosis is delayed, the pet’s health can decline rapidly over 24–48 hours, leading to death if not immediately treated.
Signs to look out for include increased thirst and urination, increased appetite and weight loss. However, some dogs and up to 50% of cats with diabetes have a reduced appetite.
Diabetic cats’ posture may change to a
flat-footed stance
and they may lose jumping ability. Diabetic dogs are prone to
cataracts
.
Diagnosis involves documenting persistently high blood glucose levels along with glucose in the urine.
Certain
or
tests
tests can confirm the diagnosis by measuring average blood glucose over the past several weeks.
In cats, early diagnosis before clinical signs appear can be difficult because the stress of visiting the vet often
raises blood glucose levels
. Multiple measurements and/or urine analysis, preferably at home, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
What are the treatment options?
Tailored monitoring and treatment can improve quality of life and reduce euthanasia rates. In cats, early intervention can potentially
delay onset of clinical diabetes
and reduce the burden of long-term insulin treatment.
Insulin therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. Options range from short-acting for immediate control to intermediate and long-acting insulin for daily management.
In dogs,
types of insulin known as
“porcine lente” or “protamine zinc” are commonly used. Consistent feeding schedules and exercise help
stabilise blood glucose
.
SGLT2 inhibitors have almost
no risk of clinical signs from low blood glucose
(hypoglycemia) and can be given with food. This may help overcome common treatment barriers such as having to give twice daily injections for cats with diabetes.
However, these treatments are most effective with early diagnosis, as they require the cat to still produce enough insulin to suppress formation of
ketones
(acids your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy). Especially in the first few weeks of treatment,
ketone monitoring is crucial
to avoid life-threatening complications.
For cats showing more advanced signs of diabetes, their own insulin secretion is unlikely to be enough for management with oral SGLT2 inhibitors, and insulin injections are needed. Longer-acting insulin is more
effective for inducing remission
.
Dietary changes are essential. Low-carbohydrate diets improve remission rates for cats
when combined with
long-acting insulin. However, such diets
might not be suitable
when using SGLT2 inhibitors.
In newly diagnosed cats without other medical conditions, tight control of blood glucose levels can lead to remission in
up to 80% of cases
. Sustained weight management is then key to maintaining it without other treatment.
Dogs rarely achieve remission because the destruction of insulin-producing cells in type 1 diabetes is irreversible.
Diabetic cats and dogs can have a good life
Diabetes in dogs and cats is manageable with the right vet care, owner commitment, and adjustments to diet and body weight.
Advances in
home glucose monitoring
, including continuous monitors, mean vets and pet owners can better track and manage blood glucose.
For most diabetic dogs it’s a lifelong condition. For cats, the prospect of remission, as well as giving owners hope, underscores the need for awareness of early symptoms and early vet care.
Through diligent weight management, diet, glucose monitoring and insulin dose adjustments, pets with diabetes can live healthy, fulfilling lives."
Cat lovers rejoice: watching online videos lowers stress and makes you happy,https://theconversation.com/cat-lovers-rejoice-watching-online-videos-lowers-stress-and-makes-you-happy-43460,"Watching cute cat videos and looking at their online pictures may not be a waste of time. A new study has found doing so could boost energy levels and increase feelings of happiness.
Published in the journal
Computers in Human Behavior
the study even suggests that watching internet cats could be used as a form of digital pet therapy or stress relief.
Internet data shows two million cat videos were posted on YouTube as of 2014, totalling nearly 26 billion views. Celebrity cats – such as Grumpy Cat and and Lil BUB – have also sprung up on social media, garnering mass followings.
This pop culture phenomenon “compelled” Assistant Professor Jessica Gall Myrick from Indiana University Media School to explore the motivations behind the surging love of online felines.
She set out to find the characteristics present in the types of users who engaged in procrastinatory online cat viewing and the potential effects of this activity on their emotional states.
“Some people may think watching online cat videos isn’t a serious enough topic for academic research, but the fact is that it’s one of the most popular uses of the internet today,” Assistant Professor Myrick said.
“If we want to better understand the effects the internet may have on us as individuals and on society, then researchers can’t ignore internet cats anymore.”
The researcher collected data using a questionnaire distributed by a “snowball” technique, through Facebook users sharing the questionnaire.
The method garnered nearly 7,000 participants largely with the help of it being shared on celebrity cat Lil BUB’s Facebook page.
The ten-minute survey asked participants to supply details including that of past and present pet ownership, describe whether they were cat or dog people and rate their level of shyness – a necessary exploration based on prior
research
that linked introversion to more frequent internet use.
About 36% participants described themselves as a “cat person”, while about 60% said they liked both cats and dogs.
Drawing on some well-known research that showed spending time with pets improved people’s moods and sense of well-being, the study found negative emotions were lower and positive emotions higher after viewing internet cats.
UNSW psychology lecturer Lisa Williams said that what may initially seem like “fluffy” research had a “lot more teeth” than what some might think.
“It’s very clever research. I think that the researcher is using some well-known theories to back up why she’s investigating the emotional outcomes of watching cat videos.”
Postdoctoral Fellow in Psychology at Flinders University Owen Churches said it was an important and timely study.
“Cats on the internet are part of the world that we have created for ourselves and that we now occupy and I think it’s limiting of psychologists to not study phenomena that are manifestly part of our psychological world.”
“The author’s suggestion that this is potentially a digital pet therapy is quite accurate and quite a sensible link to make,” he added.
The study showed people who were current or past cat owners were more frequent viewers of internet cats. It also showed that people who were rated as shy and agreeable spent more time looking at cats online.
Participants who were measured as having emotional stability spent less time consuming internet cat content. However, there was no significant association with extroversion, conscientiousness, openness to experiences, or well-being.
Professor Myrick also explored the interrelationship between feelings of guilt and enjoyment related to obsessively watching cats online; testing a conceptual model that links procrastination, guilt, happiness, and enjoyment.
“Even if they are watching cat videos on YouTube to procrastinate or while they should be working, the emotional pay-off may actually help people take on tough tasks afterwards,” Professor Myrick said.
Limitations noted in the study were that the sample used was not random and consisted mainly of women and those who had an affinity for cats.
Lisa A Williams pointed out that while cat videos may be a useful tool for people who liked cats, those predisposed to porcupines might find more pleasure watching porcupine videos than cat videos."
Like cats and dogs: dingoes can keep feral cats in check,https://theconversation.com/like-cats-and-dogs-dingoes-can-keep-feral-cats-in-check-114748,"The role of dingoes in the Australian landscape is highly debated between ecologists, conservationists and graziers. They kill livestock, but also hunt introduced animals and keep kangaroo populations in check.
Now new research sheds more light on the benefits dingoes bring to the outback. For the first time, our research clearly shows that dingoes suppress feral cat numbers.
Our research, published recently in
Ecosystems
, used the world’s largest fence to compare essentially identical environments with and without dingoes. Over the course of the six-year study, dingoes drove down cat numbers – and kept them down.

Feral cats are out of control
Feral cats are a serious conservation threat. They have been linked to the extinction of at least 20 mammal species in Australia and threaten the ongoing survival of more than 100 native species.
For our study, we asked whether “top-down” pressure from dingoes (through direct killing and competition for food) had a greater influence on controlling cat numbers than “bottom-up” effects (the availability of shared food sources preyed on by cats).

We conducted our study by comparing the numbers of dingoes, cats and their major prey species on either side of the
dingo fence
in the Strzelecki Desert. The fence runs along the borders of New South Wales and South Australia and was originally built to exclude dingoes from sheep grazing lands in NSW.
The state border follows the longitude line 141 east, so the fence does not demarcate any natural boundary. It simply cuts a straight line through sand dunes with similar landforms and vegetation on either side. Thus the dingo fence provides a unique opportunity to study apex predators’ effects on ecosystems: dingoes are common on the SA side, “outside” the fence, whereas on the NSW “inside” of the fence, dingoes are rare due to intensive persecution by humans.

Let's move the world's longest fence to settle the dingo debate
We collected data from sites on either side of the fence in the Strzelecki Desert, at roughly four-month intervals between 2011 and 2017. Dingo and cat scat was collected at each site, to analyse and compare diets, and spotlight searches were used to record numbers of dingoes, feral cats, as well as two of their common shared food sources: rabbits and hopping mice.
Spotlight surveys revealed dingoes to be virtually absent from study areas inside the fence, with only four dingoes recorded during the study. Where dingoes were rare inside the fence, cat numbers closely followed fluctuations of their prey species consistently over the six-year span of our study. As prey numbers increased, cat numbers also increased, and similarly as prey numbers declined, cat numbers also declined.

Outside the fence, where dingoes were common, it was quite a different story. There, cat numbers were consistently lower, with numbers of both cats and dingoes following fluctuations in prey numbers across the first two years of the study. However, from 2013 onward, dingo numbers remained high and matched trends in their prey numbers for the remainder of the study.
During this time, cat numbers remained low, and by the end of 2015, cats had virtually disappeared from our study sites outside the fence and were not recorded during spotlight surveys between November 2015 and the end of our study in July 2017.
The most likely explanation for this drastic reduction in cat populations is through interference competition – either by dingoes killing some cats or by scaring others away from habitats in which they would usually hunt. Indeed, we occasionally found cat remains in dingo scats, which suggests dingoes prey on cats.
Although our scat analyses indicated that dingoes and cats eat similar foods, there was no evidence that competition for food was a major factor in how dingoes reduce cat populations. This is because prey were plentiful outside the fence, where dingoes were common and cats were rare.

Why do some graziers want to retain, not kill, dingoes?
This research show how dingoes can help conservation efforts by suppressing feral cat populations. It adds to previous work showing dingoes are important in maintaining healthy ecosystems, as they reduce and eradicate feral herbivores like pigs and goats, and stop kangaroos from overpopulating districts.

Extinctions of Australian mammals have long been blamed on foxes and cats – but where’s the evidence?,https://theconversation.com/extinctions-of-australian-mammals-have-long-been-blamed-on-foxes-and-cats-but-wheres-the-evidence-253542,"In 1938, zoologist Ellis Le Geyt Troughton
mourned
that Australia’s “gentle and specialized creatures” were “unable to cope with changed conditions and introduced enemies”.
The role of these “enemies” – namely, foxes and feral cats – in
driving dozens
of Australia’s animals towards extinction has solidified into a
scientific consensus
. This is a simple and plausible story: wily new predators arrive, decimating unwary native mammals.
In response, conservationists and governments have
declared war
on foxes and cats with large-scale trapping, shooting and poisoning campaigns.
But did foxes and cats definitely
cause the extinction
of animals such as the desert bandicoot, lesser bilby and the central hare-wallaby?  Our
new research
shows the evidence base is nowhere near as strong as you might assume.
Feral cats are now found across almost all of Australia. But cats took decades to cover the continent.

What did we do?
We catalogued mammal species experts believe have either declined or gone extinct due to predation by foxes (57 species) and cats (80 species) and searched for primary sources linking foxes and cats to their decline. To assess the evidence, we then asked three simple questions.
1. Did extinctions follow the arrival of new predators?
A
common claim
is that extinctions followed fox and cat arrival and spread.
But is it definitely true? To find out, we compiled the last recorded sightings of extinct mammals and compared them to maps estimating the arrival of
foxes
and
cats
in the area. We included local extinctions (extinct in an area) and full extinctions, where the species is no more.
We found extinction records for 164 local populations of 52 species. Nearly a third (31%) of these records did not confirm the timeline that extinctions followed predator arrival. We found that 44% of the extinctions blamed on foxes and 20% on cats could have happened before predator arrival.
Records can be inaccurate. But our findings mean we can’t authoritatively state that foxes and cats were at the scene of these crimes. For instance, banded hare-wallabies now live only on two islands in Western Australia. They were last recorded on the mainland 4–30 years before foxes are known to have arrived.
Then there are examples of coexistence. The eastern barred bandicoot lived alongside cats on the mainland for more than 150 years before becoming extinct on the mainland, and the two species continue to live together in Tasmania.
The timeline for local or full extinction doesn’t match predator arrival for species such as banded hare-wallabies (top left), broad-faced potoroos (top centre), burrowing bettongs (top right) as well as southern pig-footed bandicoots (bottom left), eastern barred bandicoots (bottom centre) and plains rats (bottom right)

2. Is there evidence linking foxes and cats to extinctions?
Our study found experts attribute predation pressure from foxes and cats as a reason why 57% of Australia’s threatened mammals are at risk of extinction.
For this claim to be based on evidence, we would expect to find ecological studies finding these links in most cases.
We found 331 studies and categorised each according to whether they contained predator and prey population data and if they found a link between introduced predators and a decline in the prey species.
For 76% of threatened species attributed to foxes and 80% for cats, we found no studies supporting this with population data.
Experts aren’t claiming foxes and cats are the main threat in all these cases. But when we analysed the data only for the species experts consider at high risk from foxes and cats, we found similar results.
For example, foxes and cats are ranked a
“high” threat
to mountain pygmy possums. We found anecdotes that foxes and cats sometimes eat these possums, but
no studies
showing they cause population decline.
Similarly, foxes are
widely linked
to the decline of black-footed rock-wallabies. But this claim
came from
poison-baiting studies which did not report data showing what happened to the fox population. This is important, because
killing foxes
does not necessarily reduce fox populations.
In 50% of studies reporting population data, there was no negative association with these predators. This further weakens the claim that foxes and cats directly drive extinctions.
For example, cats are
considered a “high” threat
to long-nosed potoroos. But population studies on these potoroos
don’t support
this. In fact, these small, seemingly vulnerable animals
are able
to live alongside feral cats.
By contrast, we did find one species – the
brush-tailed rabbit rat
– which had compelling evidence across all studies linking cats to its decline.
Long-nosed potoroos would be an appealing meal for foxes and cats. But these small marsupials have found ways to evade predators.

3. Do more introduced predators mean fewer threatened mammals?
If introduced predators cause extinctions, we would expect to find that higher predator numbers is associated with lower prey numbers (and vice versa). While correlations such as these don’t prove causation, they can give an indication.
We conducted a meta-analysis and found a negative correlation with foxes. The more foxes, the fewer threatened mammals.
This is the strongest evidence we found for introduced predators putting pressure on these species. But there are limitations – these findings would be typical for native predators and prey as well.
We found no evidence for a correlation with cats.
Our meta-analysis of correlations between the abundance of threatened mammals and introduced predators suggests more foxes were correlated with fewer threatened mammals, while cats were not. Light-coloured dots represent individual correlations. Dark-coloured dots show the combined correlations. Vertical lines show variability in the data.

More lines of evidence
These aren’t the only lines of evidence. Making the strongest case for fox and cat pressure are studies finding extinct species often fall within a
critical weight range
– 35 grams to 5.5 kilos – which are good-sized prey for foxes and cats.
While
this finding
has
been
debated
, it remains strong evidence.
But these studies don’t explain why Australian animals would be uniquely vulnerable. For millennia, Australia’s mammals have lived alongside predators such as dingoes, Tasmanian devils, quolls and wedge-tailed eagles.
Conservationists have long believed Australia’s endemic mammals are naive or poorly adapted to survive alongside ambush hunters such as foxes and cats. But there’s
no current evidence
for this.
Our research has shown Australian rodents
respond to foxes
in the same way as do North American and Middle Eastern rodents, who evolved alongside foxes.
One line of argument goes further to suggest that foxes, cats and dingoes have “
rewired
” Australian ecosystems following the loss of the thylacine, Tasmanian devil (once common on the mainland) and the long-extinct marsupial lion.
What should we conclude?
We didn’t set out to prove or disprove the idea that foxes and cats drive extinctions. Instead, our study lays out the available
primary evidence
of historic records and studies to allow readers to draw their own conclusions.
Sweeping claims have been made about Australia’s introduced predators. But when we analyse the evidence base, we find it ambiguous, weak and – in most cases – lacking.
Foxes and cats have been largely convicted by expert opinion which, while useful, can be prone to
bias and groupthink
.
So what did cause Australia’s mammal extinctions? The honest answer is we don’t know. It could be foxes and cats – but it could also be something else."
Why cats are fussy eaters but dogs will consume almost anything,https://theconversation.com/why-cats-are-fussy-eaters-but-dogs-will-consume-almost-anything-50568,"Anyone who’s watched a cat throwing up after munching on grass knows that our feline friends aren’t natural plant eaters. So you might be surprised to discover that these carnivorous animals share some important genes that are more typically associated with herbivores. And this might help explain why cats aren’t always easy to please when it comes to food.
New research
suggests that cats possess the genes that protect vegetarian animals from ingesting poisonous plants by giving them the ability to taste bitter. Animals use their sense of taste to detect whether a potential food is nutritious or harmful. A sweet taste signals the presence of sugars, an important source of energy. A
bitter taste
, on the other hand, evolved as a defence mechanism against harmful toxins commonly found in plants and unripe fruits.
Evolution has repeatedly tweaked animals’ taste buds to suit various dietary needs. Changes in an animal’s diet can eliminate the need to sense certain chemicals in food, and so receptor
genes mutate
, destroying their ability to make a working protein.

One example of this comes from strictly meat-eating cats, who can no longer
taste sweetness
. But if bitter detection evolved to warn of plant toxins, then it stands to reason that cats, which (usually) eschew plants, shouldn’t be able to taste bitter either. Humans and other vegetable-munching animals can taste bitter because we possess bitter taste receptor genes. If cats have lost the ability to taste bitterness, we should find that their receptor genes are riddled with mutations.
Geneticists at the
Monell Chemical Senses Center
in Philadelphia scoured the genome of cats and other carnivorous mammals like dogs, ferrets, and polar bears to see if our carnivorous cousins have
bitter genes
. They were surprised to find that cats have 12 different genes for bitter taste. Dogs, ferrets, and polar bears are equally well endowed. So, if meat eating animals are unlikely to encounter any bitter morsels, why do they boast genes for tasting bitterness?
Taste test
To find out, Peihua Jiang, a molecular biologist at Monell, put cat taste buds to the test. He inserted the cat taste receptor gene into human tissue cells in the lab. When combined, the cell and the gene act as a taste receptor that responds to chemicals dropped onto it.
Jiang discovered that the cat’s taste receptors responded to bitter chemicals found in toxic plants and to compounds that also activate human bitter receptors. The cat bitter taste receptor, known as Tas2r2, responded to the chemical denatonium benzoate, a bitter substance commonly smeared on the fingernails of nail-biting children.
So why have cats retained the ability to detect bitter tastes? Domestic cats owners know how unpredictable cats’ dietary choices can be. Some of the “presents” cats bring to their owners include frogs, toads, and other animals that can contain bitter and toxic compounds in their skin and bodies. Jiang’s results show that bitter receptors empower cats to detect these potential toxins, giving them the ability to reject noxious foods and avoid poisoning.

But how often do meat-loving cats actually get exposed to bitter and toxic compounds in their diet, compared with the plethora of plant toxins that their vegetarian counterparts have to contend with? Jiang suggests this is not enough to explain why cats have retained such an arsenal of receptors.
Instead, cat taste receptors may have evolved for reasons other than taste. In humans, bitter taste receptors are found not only in the mouth, but also in the heart and in the lungs, where they are thought to
detect infections
. It remains to be seen if feline bitter receptor genes also double-up as disease detectors.
The discovery of feline bitter receptors might explain why cats have got a reputation as picky eaters. But their unfussy canine counterparts have a similar number of bitter taste receptors – so why are cats so finicky? One answer might lie in how the cat receptors detect bitter-tasting compounds.
Research published
earlier this year by another team of researchers showed that some of the cat taste receptors are especially sensitive to bitter compounds, and even more sensitive to denatonium than the same receptor in humans.
Perhaps cats are also more sensitive to bitter chemicals than dogs, or they may detect a greater number of bitter compounds in their everyday diet. Food that tastes bland to us or to a dog could be an unpleasant gastronomic experience for cats. So rather than branding cats as picky, perhaps we should think of them as discerning feline foodies."
The ‘bully cats’ bred to resemble American bully dogs and how fashion is creating mutant pet breeds,https://theconversation.com/the-bully-cats-bred-to-resemble-american-bully-dogs-and-how-fashion-is-creating-mutant-pet-breeds-240729,"Pedigree cat breeding has long had its controversies but a new trend for cats bred to look like American bully XL dogs could be one of the most worrying fads yet.
So-called “bully cats”
originated in the US
and are a result of
mutant breeding
. Unlike
pedigree
breeding, which focuses on keeping animals purebred, mutant breeding involves intentionally combining genetic mutations to create cats with a specific look. In this case, they mix the gene that causes hairlessness in sphynx cats with the gene responsible for the short legs of munchkin cats, making bully cats a munchkin-sphynx cross.
These cats share a close resemblance to
bully dogs
, a group of breeds characterised by a
solid build, wide body
and short coat. American XL bully dogs were
banned in the UK
in 2023. Recently, bully cats have made
their way to the UK
, where
social media accounts
promoting this new mutant breed have emerged.
YouTube users criticised this video for “making it normal” to breed animals with genetic health problems.
According to
Marjan van Hagen and Jeffrey de Gier, animal welfare and reproduction experts at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, these mutations can have serious health consequences for the cats and limit their freedom of movement. Kittens already have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature and this is made even more difficult by hairlessness and makes them more suspectible to respiratory infections.
A lack of fur can also lead to sunburn and skin cancer in hairless cats. Like the sphynx, bully cats also lack whiskers, which cats depend on for communication, navigating their environment and gauging spatial dimensions.
Short-legged cats also face problems. Short legs limit their ability to jump, can put cats at a disadvantage in fights and can lead to painful health conditions. Although breeders claim that bully cats are
healthy and long-lived
, it’s still too early to determine their long-term health and welfare.
Some breeders also say they are screening the cats they breed from for conditions such as heart disease. This can help prevent health problems, but it can’t overcome all of the health and welfare issues with mutant breeding.
A May 2024 study by veterinary epidemiologist
Kendy Tzu-Yun Teng
and colleagues assessed annual life expectancy in UK cats and found that the average cat lives nearly 12 years, but sphynx cats have the shortest lifespan — just 6.7 years. Bully cats, being both hairless and short-legged, may face twice the number of challenges encountered by sphynx and munchkin breeds.
In the wild, unrelated species that face comparable environmental challenges often develop similar traits, a process known as
“convergent evolution”
. Despite coming from different evolutionary paths, these species evolve to look and behave in similar ways.
Take the
sugar glider
from Australia, for example. It looks and behaves much like the US flying squirrel, yet one is a marsupial and one is a mammal. Both animals faced the problem of how to move efficiently in a forest canopy, and evolved the same solution.
Sugar gliders are not related to flying squirrels.

In a similar way, many domesticated animals share common traits, collectively known as
“domestication syndrome”
including increased tameness, juvenile behaviour, floppy ears and smaller teeth. Traits that helped them adjust to life with humans. However, the resemblance between bully cats and dogs doesn’t come from this gradual, natural process. Instead, it’s the result of selective
breeding based on aesthetics
.
Veterinarian and animal welfare scientist Wenche Farstad summarises this as breeding for
“curiosity or cuteness”
in their 2018 paper on ethical breeding. While people normally find traits like
round eyes
and
short nose length
to be particularly cute, breeding for hairlessness and shorter legs is better aligned with the concept of breeding for curiosity.
In this case, the resemblance between bully cats and dogs is more about human-driven design, where appearance is prioritised. The bully cat seems to have been intentionally bred to resemble the bully dog, perhaps due to their perception among young men as a kind of
status symbol
.
Could bully cats survive without humans?
Mutations that hinder survival and reproduction typically become rare in nature. However, humans bypass natural selection by choosing which animals breed, allowing traits that would be disadvantageous in the wild to persist.
Examples of this can be seen across a number of domestic species. For example, due to the muscularity of their calves, Belgian Blue cattle require
caesarean sections
in more than 90% of births.
Another farm animal, the modern broiler chicken, has been bred to
grow much faster
than its wild counterparts. If allowed to live longer than their usual slaughter age, many would not survive. Bully cats would probably also struggle to survive in the wild, without humans to care for them.
Crossbreeding programs can help
increase genetic diversity
and reduce harmful traits in many breeds. However, for mutant breeds like the bully cat – where hairlessness and short legs are defining traits – this isn’t a realistic solution.
Prospective pet owners need to be aware of the risks associated with owning mutant and experimental breeds. Consumers hold purchasing power. We can discourage breeders from prioritising aesthetics over the health and welfare of the animals by refusing to buy breeds with extreme traits.
A fashion toward ethical breeding could ensure future cats are healthier, happier and free to enjoy natural feline behaviour like climbing, jumping and lounging in the sun. We should let cats be cats."
Physics and psychology of cats – an (improbable) conversation,https://theconversation.com/physics-and-psychology-of-cats-an-improbable-conversation-176020,"Have you wondered why cats are so nimble and seem to fit perfectly in cups, boxes and other small places? Or how cats communicate with humans?
Marc Abrahams, editor of the
Annals of Improbable Research

Jean Berko Gleason
, psycholinguist and professor emerita of Psychological and Brain Science at Boston University, and
Marc-Antoine Fardin

Physics and psychology of cats - an (improbable) conversation.
Fardin is the winner of the Ig Nobel Prize in physics in 2017 for exploring the use of fluid dynamics to probe the question “
Can a cat be both solid and a liquid
?”
Below are some highlights from the discussion. Please note that answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.
As many cat owners know, cats tend to like squeezing themselves into small spaces.

Marc Abrahams: Rheology is studying anything, everything that flows, and, thanks to you, largely, that now includes cats. How did that happen?
Marc-Antoine Fardin:
I was on the internet a few years ago, and I saw this set of webpages that were discussing whether cats are liquid. And then they had the definition of a liquid. And usually the definition of a liquid is material that takes the shape of its container. [For example,] if I pour liquid into a mug, the liquid is going to take the shape of the mug, and if I pour it into a wine glass it is going to take the shape of the glass.
If you look at a bunch of different cats, there are many different pictures and experiments that have been run by many people around the world where you see the cats taking the shape of the container [they are in], like a box or a sink. People were asking this question. And so I took this question and put it into the modern lingo of rheology.
Are cats a liquid if they take the shape of the container they are in?

Marc Abrahams: What does the compressibility of cats refer to?
Marc-Antoine Fardin:
Gas in comparison to liquid is compressible. So it means that if you were to push it, you could change its volume. And so for cats, once you answer that the cat might be a liquid, you might also push the question a little further and ask if in some cases a cat could be a gas. And so if it is a gas, it should be compressible. And that’s an experiment that I have not done because I don’t want to get into any trouble.
Beth Daley (to Jean Berko Gleason): Based on your expertise as a psycholinguist, have humans been communicating efficiently with cats? And if not, how should they?
Jean Berko Gleason:
Cats have been communicating very efficiently with us. We’ve had cats as pets for, like, 14,000 years. And in 14,000 years, the cats have told us that they want to live with us, and that they would like a comfortable bed, and they want food, and they want us to snuggle with them. In other words, the cats have really communicated all of their interests and needs such that we’re running around doing whatever they have in mind. So they’re doing a very good job.
Our problem with communicating with cats is that you can try to train cats, but [they are very stubborn]. For instance, cats who take part in psychology studies frequently … just leave. The cats do not hang around for the rest of your study.
What people are trying to do really is learn much more about their body language. One of the things that has happened in recent years is that we [have] begun to understand that cats have different facial expressions. And there [are] some bits of research recently in which veterinarians, or people who work in cat hospitals, they’re able to tell the five or six cat facial expressions apart, but we’re not terribly good at that.

Cat muzzles: cruel or useful?,https://theconversation.com/cat-muzzles-cruel-or-useful-118885,"It’s not unusual to slap a muzzle on a dog if it’s being aggressive or not keen on being given an injection, but a muzzle is not part of your average cat’s wardrobe. Yet there they are
online
, by the dozen, in a wide range of styles and colours.
Cats are independent creatures. Although many enjoy being petted, any more handling than that and they’re likely to get their claws out, as anyone who has ever tried to take a cat to the vet will know. Cats react badly to
visiting the vet
and often need to be restrained when they are examined or treated. Clearly, there needs to be a way to prevent injury to the cat and the people involved and in these situations. A muzzle may be just the thing.
But not all muzzles are created equal. The one below is not one of the better ones. The idea that a cat that cannot see is a less stressed cat is unlikely to be true. It may mean that it will struggle less before or during the procedure, but that may be because a
terrified cat will often freeze
.

It is clear from the body position of the cat in the photograph that it is not relaxed and is feeling very anxious. It is likely that it will be even more frightened the next time it has treatment.
Some cats that are very stressed or frightened will
breathe through their mouth
, which is not possible with this muzzle because of the tiny hole in the end. Indeed, if the muzzle becomes slightly displaced during a veterinary procedure, it may cover the nostrils and the cat won’t be able to breathe at all. A much better design is available for those times when veterinary treatment is unavoidable. Although the one below looks rather bulkier, it lets the cat see, miaow and hiss, breathe and pant.

The important question is when these devices should be used. For emergency treatment, especially of stray or feral cats that are not used to being handled, it may be unavoidable. Even for a cat that is used to lots of different situations and has been handled a lot, there may be times when it cannot cope with an invasive examination or treatment, and a muzzle may be necessary.
But for most routine procedures, it should be possible to train your cat to accept handling of all types. If you do it well and keep up the training, the cat may come to consider a visit to the vet or groomer a pleasure. Cats can even learn to tolerate claw clipping if the training is done well – although cats, even indoor cats, that are given the opportunity to express normal scratching behaviour will keep their own claws in order.
Positive reinforcement training (which some people know as “clicker training”, where a sound tells the animal that their good behaviour will shortly result in a treat) is used to train many animals, including zoo animals such as
elephants
and
chimpanzees
, to accept examination and treatment – and cats are quite easy to clicker train.
Train from early
Kittens should be handled from a very young age and introduced to as many unusual stimuli as possible, in a kind and sensitive way, before they reach maturity. Ask your vet if you can bring your kitten to the clinic so that staff can pet and feed the kitten. If your vet practice won’t allow this, then consider changing to a practice that will.
Cats can have their meals placed in the cat basket (with the door open) and be free to use it as a bed. All these precautions together should mean that there is no need to muzzle the cat for travel or routine procedures.
My other concern about cat muzzles is that they may become the default position for some people whose cats have problems in the home, either with biting or with calling, when a queen is in season, for example. Muzzles are not under veterinary control – anyone can design, sell, buy and use them. And if misused, they have the potential to cause considerable suffering."

Declawing a cat might sound as simple as trimming your pet’s nails. But it’s actually major surgery.

Scratching things is a
natural behavior for cats
. It lets them get healthy stretching exercise and also provides stress relief.
A cat might accidentally scratch you while playing. Or a cat might aggressively lash out with its claws. A pet owner usually chooses onychectomy, as declawing surgery is technically called, to prevent scratching injuries to people or damage to objects.
Declawing will not address the real issue causing a cat to behave aggressively, so the risk of injury from biting remains. One study found that
almost 50% of cats occasionally display aggression
toward both people they know and strangers.
This surgery comes with risks of complications. Right after being declawed,
the cat will be in pain
. Vets will prescribe medicine to help manage the
immediate pain
. There may also be bleeding, swelling and infection.
One study found that
42% of declawed cats had ongoing long-term pain
and about a quarter of declawed cats limped. In up to 15% of cases, the
claws can eventually regrow
after the surgery.
Once a cat is declawed, it must stay indoors only. Removing the claws removes the cat’s main way to defend itself and climb well.
Some pet owners see declawing as their last option before getting rid of a cat that scratches. The American Veterinary Medical Association “
strongly encourages
” people to learn more about the procedure before signing a cat up. It’s possible an owner might not understand normal scratching behavior or how serious the surgery is.
Many veterinarians, including me, do not perform declawing surgery. In most cases it’s because they feel the elective procedure is not medically necessary and that it’s not a humane choice for cats.
Declawing is illegal in some American cities, including Los Angeles and Denver, and the state of New York. The U.K., Australia and many parts of the European Union and Canada have also
outlawed declawing
.
Frequent nail trimming and protective nail caps can go a long way toward cutting down on scratching damage.

If you have a cat that just won’t stop scratching, there are some other solutions. Frequent nail trimming and the use of plastic nail caps over the cat’s claws can help. Offering scratching posts and other forms of
environmental enrichment
can also reduce scratch damage. Veterinarians can prescribe therapies to reduce feline anxiety, too, including medications and pheromone diffusers that spread calming chemicals that cats naturally release.
Living with a cat comes with the responsibility to keep that pet healthy and content. That means finding a fair balance between protecting the health of family members and that of the household cat. It may also mean coming to terms with the idea that some cats express their normal need to scratch on the furniture. Fortunately, veterinarians are available to discuss options to keep everyone in the household comfortable and happy.
